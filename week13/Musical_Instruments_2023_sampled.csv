The other manufactures price with shipping was now just $3 shy of the K & M.  I wanted the screw, mount design the same so for all the reasons above, I went back to K & M.

5.0,"Great reference, works great at lower volumes.","These monitors have done wonders for the quality of mixes I am producing.  What I mix is conveyed clearly and similarly when I re-listen on earbuds or in cars.  They are accurate at lower volumes.

I was throwing so much bass resonance from vibrating a desk, and getting stereo image completely wrong until I got them to the right height.  Once moved into position and properly insulated, I immediately noticed heard all the EQ doctoring I had made in previous mixes.

5.0,Good value for entry level ukulele,"The ukulele is a fun and inexpensive musical instrument.  It's easy to learn and has a distinctive sound.  There *are* professional-quality instruments out there, but pretty much every ukulele I've ever seen is a glorified toy guitar.  This product is no different.  But for an entry level ukulele this is a pretty good value.<br /><br />The ukulele itself is attractive:  i'm skeptical whether it's real mahogany wood, but it's an attractive mahogany finish with a natural wood grain.  The filigree around the sound hole and contrasting arm rest are a nice touch.  The construction is thin and light, but this is to be expected at this price point.<br /><br />How does it play?  Pretty well.  It comes with an automatic tuner that clips to the headstock.  There are dozens of apps out there that will do this for free, but it's a nice touch and added convenience.  For the first day or two the ukulele needed serious retuning after every couple of songs.  Usually almost a full half-step.  This is the normal break-in process for nylon strings, and I expect this won't be a long term problem.<br /><br />Along with the ukulele and tuner you get a cordura case, a strap with a Southwestern vibe, a set of extra strings, and some picks.  None of these accessories scream ""premium quality"" but they don't seem cheap either.  For the price point they are better than average.<br /><br />Short story:  great pick-up-and-play instrument for the casual user at a modest price point.  I'm very happy with it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KeTRr4KKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KeTRr4KKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KeTRr4KKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B27Q63L2,B0BF5LVYMQ,AE4CCSI4THUS3STOV5MK72Q7AOHQ,1669486106969,0,False,2022-11-26 18:08:26.969

4.0,"Attractive and well made, but has a design flaw","Out of the box this guitar hanger is attractive and well crafted. It is very easy to assemble and no harder to install than any other hanger, just 2 screws. The posts utilize a self locking bolt that allows you to simply hand turn them for installation and adjustment. Once installed it is very easy to adjust. It holds my bass and baritone 6 string electric just as easily as my standard acoustic.<br /><br />Rating would have been 5 stars but for a significant design flaw. The knobs at the ends of the posts are too large to avoid contacting the instrument when hanging or removing it. The drawback to this is that you MUST turn your instrument sideways to put it on (or take it off). Even then you will likely knock the wooden knobs against the finish of your instrument. This could cause wear in the long term.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51cOMIxd8DL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51cOMIxd8DL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51cOMIxd8DL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+9v3WdYVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+9v3WdYVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+9v3WdYVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612lvBB73ZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612lvBB73ZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612lvBB73ZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CE11o-o2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CE11o-o2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CE11o-o2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RR830rIwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RR830rIwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RR830rIwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TTFQs7lGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TTFQs7lGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TTFQs7lGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XOLTa9VLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XOLTa9VLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XOLTa9VLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Y8XJj8b3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Y8XJj8b3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Y8XJj8b3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B8NHXV38,B0B8NHXV38,AFY5LM7VW7FDUDVNMVGJCOGGXA4A,1666983863313,2,False,2022-10-28 19:04:23.313

This is definitely gold for podcast production, even with the included beginner mic. No need to know professional software DAW, connect to computer/mobile phone, open recording software, plug and play<br /><br />Auto-tuning generally works well on many interfaces. I'm not a singer, but I thought this might be useful for someone who wants to do a little musical work. There is definitely a ton of output and input to facilitate song-making for people who are just starting out.<br /><br />Only music, chat, and loopback work as expected. Nothing to complain about! I didn't need noise reduction, so I turned it off via the ""NC"" button on the PC control software. This is my favorite point, I can directly operate the sound card via the computer during the live broadcast of the game, without having to operate the hardware.<br /><br />In addition, the Ducking on the sound card works very well. After I play the background music through Bluetooth, as long as I speak, the background music can be weakened.

5.0,A solid performer for the price,"I recently bought a second Eurolive B205D 150 Watt portable PA/Monitor to pair up with the unit that I've owned and used for several years now. I have gotten tons of use out of my first B205D in many circumstances: portable home speaker for record player & digital devices, live sound monitor for music & theater, guitar amp for home practice & song writing, etc. I added the second unit to create a more permanent set up for my living room. So far, the second B205D doesn't seem to have ""broken in"" yet and settled into the richness of sound provided by my first unit (which has a 5 star sound rating because it has greater warmth/richness and sounds less tinny than my newer 3.5 star sound rated unit), but I'm feeling optimistic. I'm hoping that the manufacturing specs from the factory that produced my first B205D are being followed closely by newer production lines and other factories. I'm assuming that the same model # would not be used for units that are produced with other materials or to altered specs.<br /><br />A reliable, high quality sound unit like this is hard to find at this price. The B205D packs a lot of punch for its diminutive size, and the EQ controls on it really help to create the right sound balance for your needs.

But the one I have now has passed my inspection and was well worth my total discuss of inspector NO. 1 ... its my thought that they probley only have one inspector.  Also disturbing is the fact that the tone and volume knobs are about an inch off the guitars surface and they are installed crooked so that when they turn one side goes closer to the body than the other..... but all and all its a great guitar just not the standard you would expect for a gibson name sake and certainly not for a 400.00 price tag.",[],B001RQ3AHG,B001RQ3AHG,AE4PMD25YQDPBD367A2FFX5TLPJQ,1323456494000,1,False,2011-12-09 18:48:14.000

5.0,shockingly great guitar for the price.,"For beginners Nylon strings can make playing much easier when starting out and staying with the instrument. If you are a lefty then you realize there are far fewer guitars out there for you than if you are right handed, and flipping a right handed guitar and restringing it is not always a good option. Having to do this requires modifications that you might not be comfortable making and can cause problems if done wrong.<br />Having played LH for many years but wanting to pursue something more traditional flamenco/fingerpicking this was an exceptional guitar for the price. The feel of a classical/folk nylon string guitar is going to be different than an acoustic guitar which in many ways is closer to an electric guitar. Folk guitar necks are wider and flatter, when not amplified they can be a quieter than full sized acoustic or even drowned out entirely by the natural volume of a dreadnaught acoustic guitar. All that aside nothing sounds quite like them, on their own or mixed into an arrangement they can embellish a recording or change the mood entirely.  Either way for the price this is a great LH instrument for beginners or lifelong teenage garage band holdouts.",[],B074R4V23H,B074R4V23H,AFL32C2AV3RUIDUQ53QJMHYWS7YQ,1609950829029,1,True,2021-01-06 16:33:49.029

5.0,Fits Custom Wide-body Double Cutaway,"I needed a case with some extra body height and width to accommodate my custom guitar.  I spent a lot of time looking and was happy to finally come across this cross between a gig bag and a hard case.  I think it will be perfect for home storage as well as getting to and from lessons, etc.  I wouldn't recommend for air travel.<br /><br />Body dimensions on my particular guitar are 18.5"" tall, 10 3/8"" across at the horns, 13 1/8"" across at the bottom bell.  Headstock is 14-17 degree angle.<br /><br />The case closes snug on the guitar pictured. There is about an inch of play in the body before the case closes.  The interior is soft and padded pretty well.  The interior storage bins seem decent and are closed off from the guitar when the case is closed so i'm not worried about a capo or cord falling around loose and damaging my guitar.  Most importantly there is plenty of room for the headstock and it even has a cutaway to accommodate the angle of the headstock - hard to tell from the pics, but it is not resting on the headstock.<br /><br />My custom guitar came from thefretwire.com.  If there are other builders out there looking for a nice case to protect their custom project, this seems like a nice option.  Or if you have a wide-body guitar (like a PRS) - check your dimensions to see if it will fit.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-3-KjhpqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-3-KjhpqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-3-KjhpqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GvvWch6ZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GvvWch6ZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GvvWch6ZL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818QYzMchTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818QYzMchTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818QYzMchTL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81huOdK388L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81huOdK388L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81huOdK388L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07GQ8HH63,B07Q8NSKGS,AG6ROZ66QWDEHNET4NMQTREVKT3Q,1561159785420,2,True,2019-06-21 23:29:45.420
5.0,I don't think the world is ready for these picks yet.... But maybe you are!,"I've read the other reviews, and here's what I HONESTLY think:<br />  The material seems just like a Dunlop Nylon pick, and they actually remind me of the EVH signature picks. I don't think they wear as easily, so you will get more play time out of them for sure.<br />  These picks are totally different than anything you will ever play. It's really hard to get used to so of them and I use the T4 (which has a deeper grip/dish for lack of better terminology) to practice with, because it really forces me to almost re-learn how to pick. FOR ME, that's a great thing, because when I go back to my normal picks it's a lot easier to play really fast alternate pickings lines cleanly. The shallower gripped picks (T1/T2) are a lot more like the pick your probably used to and I think they're easier to get used to. Note that you can hold it to get the standard pick effect without the grip/dish regardless of which version you use.<br />  Now, the sound. Trust me, I am skeptical of anything that claims to alter your tone, but I think the picks really do provide a much cleaner and more articulate sound than I can get with a normal pick. The T3 and T4 are really brighter too, but in a way that just sounds more clear. I LOVE the way they sound when I use my Les Paul, and I think if I were going to record, I would HAVE to use these picks because of how great they sound. I know that sounds crazy, but it's true!<br />  These won't be for everyone, but I think they're really rad and would recommend them to anyone looking to try something different, and maybe even more challenging.",[],B06WP8SNKQ,B0731VSGH6,AHZM5MCTPV4CY2HELPMSIHWDKK4A,1510891528941,6,True,2017-11-17 04:05:28.941

5.0,This is an incredible little amp...,"A few years back, my musical tastes changed a bit & I traded in a lot of my high-end guitar gear (including my tube amps) for solid state PAs and analog synthesizers.  Recently though, my style is changing to include a lot more guitar into my sound, so I wanted to get another tube amp for practice.<br /><br />My last amp was a Fender Twin Reverb, so obviously I had pretty unrealistically high expectations to follow up, especially with a 10-watt amp under $200.  However, I was blown away by how great this little Laney Cub sounds.  The tone is gorgeous and the gain switch & low/high inputs allow for a wide range of sounds, between incredibly clean to beautifully warm & overdriven.  It plays really nice with all of my pedals, and it's built beautifully and solidly.  It's also crazy light for a tube amp!<br /><br />I'm sure a lot of people are concerned about this thing not being loud enough.  I can say with all certainty that unless you plan on gigging this thing at a large hall, you have no worries.  I can't put the follow up past 3 without the neighbors knocking on the walls.  I haven't gigged with it yet, but I have do doubts that it would work perfectly for a solo acoustic gig at small venue like a coffee shop.<br /><br />My nitpicky complaints: it would have been nice to have had a headphone jack and effects loop, but it's certainly not necessary & probably would have driven the cost up.  The external speaker out is a great addition though.  Just wish it also had a direct line out for recording with.<br /><br />These are all minor though.  This amp is a steal at $200.

My under structure on which the green foam is attached  is a plastic storage bin with slightly tapering sides. I used Elmer's Multi-Purpose Spray Adhesive to glue it all together.

2.0,"Cosmetic flaws, thin/sour sound","As per instructions on the shipping label, I contacted Kala Brand directly when I saw several irregularities on the KA-CEM I received last week. Unlike the photos on Kala's website and the seller's website, my uke has a painted black stripe down the center of the back; I could see it was paint and not a strip of joint binding because it's not straight-edge true (but very slightly wavering) and because tiny bits of paint seepage flashing are visible upon very close inspection of the edges of the stripe. Also, the top end of the stripe was slightly off-center when compared with the bottom of the neck heel. In addition, there's a nearly 2-inch-long mark (it looks like a misplaced pencil scribing line) visible on the sound board next/parallel to the right edge of the fretboard.<br /><br />Indicating that the stripe was not applied to hide any back joint blemish, a Kala rep told me that all KA-CEMs currently have the black stripe down the back (which was applied in the latest production run for some unspecified reason). But he agreed that the scribing-like mark on the sound board was an issue. He said the photos I sent to Kala would be used ""for reference in pin-pointing cosmetic flaws with our factories.""<br /><br />I'm still deciding whether to use my 30-day return privileges with the seller. The flip-side is the uke otherwise looks nice, plays well, and sounds good. (The black strips around the outer edges of the uke's top and bottom appear to be real binding strips, not paint.)<br /><br />UPDATE (10/13): I should have returned this when I had the chance; instead, I've retired it to its box and only play the far superior Oscar Schmidt I subsequently bought (the OU6). By comparison, the Kala sounds thin and plinky. And though a chromatic tuner says the Kala's intonation is only somewhat sharp on the 12th-fret octave, the uke just doesn't sound true anywhere on the fretboard even though the action (string heighth) and build geometry appear correct.

5.0,My Pick for Fifty Years,"My go to guitar pick. I've been using this particular pick for fifty years. That's right. This pick has been around that long. When I began taking guitar seriously, MY FIRST guitar teacher recommended the .60 grey Dunlop nylon. I started out playing at that time my custom blue Gibson Firebird with the chrome harp engraved tailpiece and twang bar. Over the years I've started playing more acoustic guitar and have tried different picks. Even bought one of those custom picks in a 1.0 that I gave like $40.00 for. People in the acoustic genre raved about that pick brand. To me. it was like playing my HD28 with a rock. I tried many other brands. I do like the Dunlop Gel picks in a medium light gauge. But, I ended up returning to this pick, the Dunlop 44R.60 standard. I must admit, I do believe I like the Dunlop MaxGrip that I've just tried a tad better in .60 gray. Not much difference really. But the MaxGrip would probably be my choice between the two. In a blind test, I probably couldn't tell the difference in the sound. The Dunlop 44R.60 has been a reliable work horse for me and I believe it transmits the sound of the guitar strings in their purest form without adding unwanted pick distortion or pick noise.

Also they don't like a hot input, in fact quite the opposite.  Even a properly mastered input source needs to be backed off a bit to avoid clipping. I wouldn't try to mix with them without a sub,  the 3"" woofer just can't reproduce the lows accurately.  I just happened to have a spare powered sub woofer and that really made these shine. They have a bit of mid bass ""honk"" so used some foam to seal the ports. I also used foam under them for isolation.

1.0,Great Price..Very Poor Quality,"I recently purchaed this guitar case and was very disappointed with the quality when it arrived.  I bought it because it was the cheapest semi-hard case available, but I am going to return it.  It is basically cardboard with some synthetic covering.  The box that your guitar came in when purchased will provide about the same protection.  There is no lining or padding at all inside of this case.  I guess you could put a towel on the inside to add padding and stability, but that would make it look even more ""getto"".  My case arrived damaged wih a dent in the bottom from bouncing around the box.  The latches, hinges and handle are okay.  I was not expecting much for the price, but the inside of the case was the biggest disappointment.  This case will not protect your instrument and could damge it.  Finally, it is $10 cheaper on the ZZounds website, but it is still not worth it.  I saw a lot of positive reviews for this case, I totally don't get it.

3.0,Intonation is the problem,"I like this bass, but I will have to return it.<br />When I received the Ibanez, I also purchased the necessary setup tools, carefully watched John Carruthers bass setup series on Youtube couple times until I am sure I know what I am doing. I was able to adjust the neck to fix things like string buzz. I also adjusted the bridge for intonation (to certain extent).<br />The A string is a bit sharp (about two bars on my Zoom B1 Four, my Monoprice pedal tuner, and my clip-on Snark even though I adjusted the A bridge to the furthest position.<br />The E string suffers the same issue, but a bit less (only one bar sharp).<br />The D and G strings are not perfect but fine, got green light on the Zoom and Monoprice.<br />For the A string, the saddle cannot move further because its wall blocks the screw (or itself) to move deeper. For comparison, the saddle of my Yamaha bass has a hole that allow the screw go through it. I can either cut the screw a bit short, or put a tiny washer at the back of the bridge. Also, the spring is at the most compressed position, so it may not work (replacing the spring may fix this, too). In addition, I just do not want to modify a brand-new bass like this. I think I should return it so Ibanez will fix the issue for everybody. I may try again later, too.<br />I believe if the bridge is relocated about 1/4 inch further from the nut, the strings will be at proper lengths.<br />The size is so good, just very right for me to play. My fingers can reach all notes comfortably.<br />The neck is elegant, just very nice to play.<br />The look is beautiful, elegant. I really like it.<br />The build is solid, light, but not too light, just right, and comfortable to play long sessions.<br />The sound is a bit thin and shallow, but it can be fixed using any effect device. I use a Zoom B1 Four.<br />The A string snapped while I tried to make the adjustment. I emailed Ibanez and they simply replied the strings are not covered under warranty. I was expecting some friendlier customer service. Oh well, good to know. I still like the instrument, however.<br />I purchased a D'Addario EXL170S set to replace the A string. Still sound thin and shallow.<br />I think this instrument is capable and I myself can fix the issues (I just don't want to). If you are not very handy, I recommend a more setup friendly bass. For comparison, I got a Yamaha TRBX-174 and it's playable right out of the box. The strings are a bit sharp/flat but they are almost there.<br />In short, I like this bass very much. I wish it had proper intonation! I hope Ibanez will offer an improved version in the future. Keep everything as is, just improve the intonation!!!",[],B01199PW7Q,B08TTLFG6G,AEQRGOZY5IAYB5OB6R7QPBL5I62A,1617736149850,4,True,2021-04-06 19:09:09.850

4.0,Good value wireless guitar transmitter; works well with electric guitars but issues with acoustic,"Years ago, I had an AKG wireless Guitar Bug system which was swell: Good, reliable wireless connection between the transmitter and receiver, small, and not too prone to noise from other devices.<br /><br />And then the FCC took away the wireless spectrum that that (and many other pro wireless music devices) used and gave it away to someone else. In one fell swoop, those systems were no longer legal to use.<br /><br />Ugh.<br /><br />Well, now you have wireless systems that work on the standard 2.4Ghz (and some the 5Ghz) spectrum that is reserved for home use. There's nothing wrong with that spectrum in principal, but it's really crowded, and noise interference is common from things like microwave ovens and whatnot.<br /><br />So I got this set hoping for the best, but expecting potential issues.<br /><br />In practice, it's quite good. Setup is a breeze. You have a transmitter that plugs into your guitar (or other instruments) and a receiver that plugs into your amp. Turn both on, make sure they're on the same wireless band (you have a few options for that, and you can switch among them by pressing a button), and play. Having several different frequencies in the 2.4Ghz band means you can sometimes avoid noisy bands if that's a problem.<br /><br />The connection at close distances is solid, and I was even able to play my guitar upstairs with the amp downstairs. Noise is nominal. I am not sure I'd trust this for playing out, but for home use it works really well.<br /><br />I tried it with two standard electric guitars, an amplified ""modeling"" electric guitar (Variax). They all worked fine.<br /><br />Then I tried it with two acoustic/electric guitars. And it didn't work with either. To make sure the guitar port was working properly, I connected the guitars to the amp with a wired cable, and they both work. But I could not get any sound using this wireless system. So there appears to be some sort of compatibility issue with those guitars/amplification systems. Hmmm...Not so super happy about that.<br /><br />But for the electric guitars, all is good. So if your use case is electric guitars, I'd recommend this highly at the price point. But if you need wireless for acoustic/electric guitars, I would proceed with caution.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FlZ42TOoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FlZ42TOoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FlZ42TOoL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PNC6QmgBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PNC6QmgBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PNC6QmgBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RwDr6YbmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RwDr6YbmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RwDr6YbmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aN4g364JL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aN4g364JL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aN4g364JL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cJ1CDYxGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cJ1CDYxGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cJ1CDYxGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jvd+cjeWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jvd+cjeWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jvd+cjeWL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71u4jovFhZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71u4jovFhZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71u4jovFhZL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B082TS1X9K,B082TS1X9K,AH3OJBOMJC4VDM7H3WPKDYMOXWNA,1591923690578,0,False,2020-06-12 01:01:30.578

5.0,Ground Loop Hum Problems and Ebtech Hum X and other solutions,"Ground Loop Hums seem to always be a problem, wherever you go (home, music studio, etc.) As one size does not fit, you need to isolate just what piece of gear/cable is creating the ""hum."" That's an easy process in most cases, i.e., pulling/removing each plug/jack/connector.  As you find a problem, notice where its location is within the chain and continue on.  For the 1/4"" jack units (amps, etc.) the Nady HE1 unit works nicely (mine sits right on top of the amplifier). The Individual Output cable's  from my Pedal Board/Mixer and Guitar are connected to the Input side of the Nady HE1 unit.  On the Output side, make sure you use superior quality grade TS patch/jumper cable (Hose, DiMarzio), and connect to the Amp's Input channels. Another common Ground Loop Hum problem within a setup comes  from your connection of a Laptop computer.  *Note: Whether its tied into your overall loop arrangement or not, the external power cable alone can ""bleed"" over into your other audio cables. In most cases, these type Ground Loop Hums are almost always caused by the Laptop's external power cable/transformer source. Not sure?  Try running your laptop on its own battery power alone with the power cord completely removed.  If the hum goes away - you know you have a Ground Loop problem in that power cable source. Your options are simple - either do not use the external power cord and run on battery or, I would recommend using the Ebtech X  Hum eliminator for direct-connecting your laptop's ext power cord.  I've heard from many sources that the Ebtech X Hum handle 99% of that type problem (DJ's especially have this problem with their equipment). When diagnosing these hum symptoms, don't forget to check your Mixer XLR/Jack connectors also for any added ""hums"" that maybe present. If this is the case, another solution is using the Ebtech HE-2R. This unit will handle 2 channels each of both your TS & XLR cable runs. Yes, this can be a little added expense however; sometimes these extra expenses are necessary in order to fix the problems. Pricey?  Not really considering what you'll receive in the end - better quality sound and isn't that what its all about???  As we all know: ""if ya' wanna' dance, ya' gotta' pay the band.""

Only issue i'm having is sometimes it can be a tiny bit inaccurate, almost as if it was unsure if i am perfectly in tune or just a bit sharp or flat. Anyways I always get to tune in a few seconds and that little uncertainty might just be because I have a Floyd on my guitar which, while fine tuning can produce some detuning.

3.0,Very Disappointing,"The guitar arrived today.  I knew beforehand it would require some setup.  The neck had a noticeable backbow, which struck me as a little odd, but I could fix that without too much difficulty by adjusting the truss rod.  The bridge was as horrible as I'd heard about, barely useful in the configuration it was in.  I'm not certain if any music store around here carries StayTrem bridges, so I'll call around and find out if any do. The tone pot was completely unscrewed from its base plate, so I had to pull off the knob and reattach the pot.  Several of the fret ends would eventually need to be smoothed out, so they wouldn't stick out so far past the neck.<br />Then I discovered the neck was fastened in crookedly, so the low E string was just barely over the frets, almost hanging off the side.  Yes, the neck is bolted on, but it's still a royal pain to do all the measurements, then take it to a luthier shop to rent some table time so I can make a shim and install it.  This is repair work, not setup.  A brand new guitar shouldn't have this problem -- this is simply inferior manufacturing work, and the inspection sticker on the shipping bag the guitar came in was a bad joke.<br />I returned the guitar, and am expecting another one to be shipped to me soon.  The first thing I'll look at is to see if the neck is bolted on straight.  If it isn't, I'll return it and ask for my money back.  I don't need this particular guitar badly enough to work through anything beyond ordinary setup tasks.<br />I never got a chance to plug the guitar in to find out if the electronics actually worked, so I can't comment on that part.

5.0,"Fantastic product, fantastic documentation","If you're recording your own music at home, but just can't seem to get that sparkle, punch and clarity you hear on professional recordings, Izotope Ozone 4 may be just what you're looking for.  It's basically designed to polish the final stereo track that you've already mixed down from your original multi-track recording.  It offers any combination of high level EQ, mastering reverb, multiband compression, multiband exciter and loudness maximizer.  My number one recommendation when working with this is to forget the presets.  Not that there's anything wrong with them, but the Ozone Mastering Guide documentation (the pdf can be downloaded for free at their website) is absolutely FANTASTIC.  It's written in plain English, and you don't need a phD in music production and computer programming to use it.  It leads you step by step through each module of Ozone, tells you SPECIFICALLY what settings are standard and would be a good place to start, and then it explains what changing each of the settings will do to your sound.  For somebody like me, who's more interested in writing and performing music, and not a ""tech-head"", I've found this to be a very user-friendly product (as long as you download that manual!)  Now to be fair, there's still a lot of factors that go into a good recording---you're probably still not going to get your song to sound like it was recorded in a multi-million dollar studio if you're recording it in your bedroom with a few thousand dollars worth of equipment.  But if you're able to get a decent sounding recording already, but just want to take that mix to a much more professional level, then this is a great product.",[],B001TY3F1C,B001TY3F1C,AGUCDUGIEZGARQBZPCZ3J4E6PLQA,1277986252000,2,False,2010-07-01 12:10:52.000

4.0,This is a nice upgrade to many of the less featured built-in acoustic ...,"This is a nice upgrade to many of the less featured built-in acoustic preamps. It has 5 bands of EQ (if you include presence), plus a very nice and easy to read/use tuner that mutes the sound when in use, phase button, and an odd notch filter. As very high quality and inexpensive pickups/transducers are available on the market from such places as JJB Electronics, I would not recommend using the UST piezo pickup included with this kit. I didn't try it, but it didn't look so great. I would recommend an SBT from JJB like the PPS-200P which plugs directly into this preamp, a much higher quality however much lower volume than my factory UST. The factory UST worked fine too if you don't want to install a new one. I would also recommend a dab of superglue to keep the pickup cable attached as the jacks seemed to not hold so well.<br /><br />Soundwise, I don't think this preamp changes the sound much on the transducer. If it was good/bad before, it will still be that way. However the 5 EQ bands allow for greater adjustment. The included mic is very odd and has a hollow sound, as you would imagine if you were going to stick your head inside the guitar where the mic is, however I found the sound quite nice at 90% SBT and 10% mic. The mic is not a great sound by itself, but adds complexity and boom compared to the SBT alone. However the mic can create a feedback nightmare depending on the amp, room, etc.<br /><br />Feedbackwise, I tried the notch filter but while it did sort of reduce feedback, it changed the sound significantly. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it almost adds another band of EQ. However, you can't rely on it to remove feedback without affecting the sound. The phase button was the most useful way to reduce feedback. But I really didn't see much feedback unless I turned a lot more mic on or turned the guitar directly at the amp.<br /><br />Installation is a breeze, templates are included in this review. They  are a hair larger than the preamp, but it needs to be in order to fit the gasket and everything and the installation looks very clean even if your drilling is not. Just put some painters tape where you want the preamp, cut out the template and stick it to the painters tape, marker around the perimeter of the template, remove the template, drill small holes around the peremiter but within the marker lines, and then cut/punch/file out the hole and trim until the unit fits. This unit has a curve that nicely fits the guitar.<br /><br />So while this is not a revolutionary preamp, my testing showed that with a UST (or better yet a SBT) and the mic input, you can use the controls to dial in quite a large range of sound and feedback reduction options. The display is also very clear and easy to see in the dark and only turns on when a cable is plugged in.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41gVcM+ILYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41gVcM+ILYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41gVcM+ILYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00EX1HHGW,B00EX1HHGW,AFBL6Q4WO66UO7T4WQZJKOPWG7JQ,1459980188000,0,True,2016-04-06 22:03:08.000

5.0,Excellent Complement To Our ProMonitor 1000's,"We recently added surround speakers to our home theater.  After way more research and consideration than necessary, I purchased Definitive Technology ProMonitor 1000's. I looked at these Definitive Technology speaker stands but decided they were pretty pricey.  Instead, I ordered Sanus EF-28B 28"" stands.  They looked similar and were about half the price.  Maybe the Sanus stands would work for some people, but the design of the base wasn't stable enough for me and I couldn't see a satisfactory way to secure the ProMonitor speaker to the stand.  I could use two-sided tape, or drill new holes in the support pad, but either approach still left the issue of the unstable base.<br /><br />So the Sanus were returned (forty dollars for return shipping was a lesson learned) and the ProStands were ordered. Happily, they arrived four days later.  I should have ordered them in the first place!  They are well-built, stable, and our ProMonitor speakers attach with a single screw.  They are more attractive than they appear in the Amazon listing.  You can feed the speaker wire through the stand via openings at the top and bottom of the cylinder.  I would have liked to have the option to route the wire through the bottom of the stand and underneath the base, rather than out of the hole at the bottom of the cylinder.  As it is, you can see the wire trailing across the back of the base of the stand.  It's not a big deal, but it would look nicer to have the wire hidden.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent match for our ProMonitor speakers.  Highly recommend.",[],B00170IOAK,B0C2VDT44G,AG6MT3HECC4N2W5DV6C2NUJYR7ZQ,1381156189000,5,True,2013-10-07 14:29:49.000

5.0,Really cool idea for a pedal. Also made in USA!,"Very cool pedal idea. Basically, it is an overdrive pedal, and a boost pedal, inside one box. You can use dipswitches to order the effects any way that you want, for example, you can distort the boosted channel, and vice versa. The knob controls are more or less just frequency cutoffs and EQ's. Once you figure out how it all works, it is really easy to adjust it to get it to sound exactly how you want. You can set it up like two pedals to use individually, or, at the same time. It also has an interesting set of jacks that function like an external  FX loop. For example, you can boost the signal, run it out of the pedal, through another pedal or rack or whatever, then back IN the pedal, and then run THAT signal through the other half of the pedal. It is not as complicated as it sounds.<br /><br />The build quality of the pedal is fantastic. Everything is really solid, the knobs feel good. The finish on the box is like a brushed metal that I think has a clearcoat over it. It is heavy too! As for sound, I could get just about any sound I wanted out of it, with the exception being super-compressed sounds.

5.0,A great beginner mic,"[[VIDEOID:6e62bc366db325bf1238afa482150bc6]] I‚Äôm very happy and surprised about this mic!<br /><br />It‚Äôs very lightweight and the RGB isn‚Äôt too bright or too dull. I do wish we could manage and change the colours to how we wish. It was super easy to put together and the pop filter is optional , but fits right in. If you do use the pop filter it comes with, there‚Äôs an earbuds/headphone jack that it blocks.<br /><br />The mic immediately glew when I plugged it in and my pc registered it pretty fast. Took only a moment to install it and it‚Äôs data.<br /><br />To compare I currently (sadly) have a blue yeti. It‚Äôs one of the better beginner mics out there. And this one I‚Äôd say is of almost equal value and sound. I tested this with my bf, he said it sounds great and clear, and it‚Äôs almost as good as the yeti. He guessed it was a 70-80$ mic. So this mic is definitely worth it for the sound quality! And again it‚Äôs lightweight and fits easily on your desk. The cord is pretty long too! The bottom of the base also has a soft grip so it won‚Äôt slide as much or easily.<br /><br />You can tighten / loosen the one knob to change the direction of the mic. It‚Äôs in a built in shock mount as well, and it keeps the mic very stable.

5.0,Love These Strings,"I love these strings. I find them to be smooth and silky and easier on my fingers.  They tend to stay in tune and maintain their brightness longer than other types of string.  Their extra brightness works great for when I'm playing country.  However, I found I had to kick in my Graphic EQ to put back a little of what I thought was missing when I'm playing rock and blues.  Not a big deal, though.  Also, I used to change my strings before every new gig as I usually spend a couple of hours a day practicing and by the time Friday and Saturday rolled around they were pretty trashed.  Not the case with these cobalt strings.  I'm heading into my fourth gig of the last two weeks and the strings sound and feel as fresh as ever.  (Mind you I do clean them at the end of every gig and wipe them down in between sets, so that might contribute to the longevity).  I might be pushing it a bit to use them beyond tonight but I'm really happy with the mileage I get out of them and think they are well worth the extra money.",[],B007BY2F7O,B09G5QS1VD,AE5XH3X4WFKCOJJRDPAEBT6VDETA,1389423426000,3,False,2014-01-11 06:57:06.000

Comes with a nice tripod though.  I am using it with versions of Dragon Naturally Speaking.  Alternate microphone to consider would be a headset or the &#34;samson&#34; desktop microphone.

5.0,"Compact, 3 voltage options, AC sockets built in","Very well built and reliable pedalboard power supply. It has a low profile so it's easy to mount and it has 8 9V outputs, one 12v and one 18v, all individually isolated to reduce noise. There are LED lights that can be turned off with a switch. A selection of power cables are included, including a 3.5mm adapter and a reverse polarity adapter.<br /><br />One of the more interesting features is the 4 AC outlets built in to the top of the box. This allows you to plug in non grounded outlets, usually something requiring low current draw to power a lamp or something that requires AC power. That max draw on those is 600w. Another interesting thing about this power supply is that it doesn't use a large wall wart adapter, but it uses the smaller 2 prong AC connector and the DC conversion is done inside the box instead of at the wall adapter.<br /><br />Overall, I've been really happy with this power supply. Noise is basically nonexistent, and even some problematic older pedals aren't an issue since the voltage is isolated from the other pedals to minimize noise interference. One of the nicer non name brand power supplies I've seen. Reliable and seems to be very good quality.",[],B0BHHM9TTF,B0C42V8DMP,AH37PMZUFFA52Z3KSD4KLUPJTJGA_1,1671311467843,0,False,2022-12-17 21:11:07.843

5.0,Great product but with one problem for me,"I bought this to attach to a Gibraltar throne.  I use this for benchrest shooting so throne height is very important for comfort.  Problem is not all benches are the same height at the different ranges I shoot at.  when attaching this back rest it clamps around the height adjustment screw and removes about 3 inches of lowering ability.  That 3 inches is important when sitting at the bench for 3 hours our more.  I find at times I have to remove it to get comfortable.  It is very sturdy and strong, just not quite right for me sometimes.<br /><br />I changed my review to 5 stars.  I managed to modify the backrest to fit the bracket that holds the seat to the  adjusting shaft.  Now I can lower it all the way down to within 1/2 inch of bottoming out.  I removed the bracket piece that clamps to the seat bottom and tightens it to the permanent bracket.  Had to drill out the holes a bit in that permanent bracket so bolts on the bracket on the backrest now fits into those two holes.  tighten it up and now perfect.  Took all of about 15 minutes.",[],B000EY765E,B074P6SCS6,AGXBS57DK5P6C2Z6ZYTDMZ6EYQ2A,1635174974520,0,True,2021-10-25 15:16:14.520

5.0,Sounds good. Is tiny. Which is good.,"This death whistle sounds great. Is very loud. Compared to my 4 others it may be the loudest. Depending how you blow into it, you could make it more male or female sounding.  Maybe more male sounding overall.  You do have to blow into it very straight on/squared away with the mouth hole. Yes it is a hole instead of a mouth piece. Which is where the play comes Into. If you blow in on an angle it will not work right and sounds lame. Squared up with the mouth hole/whistle itself will produce a great sound. Best of all its really small. Slightly smaller than an egg but way lighter. And has a loop for hanging around the neck. The huge positive about this whistle is the size of it and the sound. The only negative is that the sound isn't readably found. Sometimes you blow into it and its right there. Other times you have to find it. It sounds great but requures a bit more finess than others. I do recommend this for its loud, horrifying, and transportable sound.

Admittedly I'm a big guy, over 250 lbs, but that's really the reason I bought this stool--I was afraid that the pinned design used by other stools wouldn't hold up.

4.0,Musedo Metro-Tuner MT-30 (Updated: 20151006),"[[VIDEOID:70f135ad490629751a8eff301253b672]] I was principally shopping for a metronome, and I was between this and similar-looking Korg models. I ultimately chose the Metro-tuner because of its multi-functionality (metronome, tuner, reference tone generator) and good price. It doesn't seem rock-solid (few things are, esp. at this price point), and the feature navigation can be annoying (shared buttons, no direct switch between functions), but it's still a nice and convenient little device, and not bad at all for the price. I also like that it uses readily-available AAA batteries. Light use for the better part of a year, and it has worked just fine. I would recommend it. (UPDATE, 20131006: I bought this in March of 2011, and it still works well after over four years of light use.)<br /><br />I've uploaded a video because I thought it'd be helpful to see the feature navigation and performance before you make your decision. My package included a tuning clip with 1/4&#34; input; a nice extra, though I don't use it, and it's not in the video.<br /><br />I hope this helps with your decision.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51O+1ucYR-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51O+1ucYR-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51O+1ucYR-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00150WENK,B00150WENK,AHG27T4K2VXX7UKGXIQHE7T4WLFA,1321247353000,44,True,2011-11-14 05:09:13.000

5.0,What An Engineering Feat,"The Selfie Stick Tripod is 1 1/8 inch thick and 7 1/4 inch long, but then the magic happens.<br /><br />When the tripod legs are slightly pulled out, the top pops out slightly.  While holding the middle, and pulling the top to expand the telescoping pole, the tripod legs slide out to full extension.  The head piece has a rubber (?) tightening mechanism to hold the smart phone.  The phone can rotate from vertical to beyond horizontal.<br /><br />The top part of the handle has a removable shutter release that allows you to be in the picture if using the tripod as a tripod rather than as a selfie stick.  The shutter release can be charged when it is out of the handle.  The remote is black but I wished it was a brighter color because it could be easy to drop and a brighter color would be easier to find.  Using a label maker with Florescent Orange tape, I will put a label on the back of the remote with my phone number.<br /><br />When using as a selfie stick the shutter release button will easily be controlled by your thumb.<br /><br />Pairing to my phone was fast and easy.  After opening the camera app on my phone, pressing the 'camera' icon button on the remote took a pictures.<br /><br />I am amazed by great engineering work and this is great engineering work.<br /><br />With any telescoping device be careful when extending and especially when retracting the telescoping pole.

It either wouldn't close while I was playing, would take a long time to close, or would randomly open while I was playing.<br /><br />Could this have been a technique issue or something wrong with my embouchure? Possibly. But I honestly don't think so, for two reasons: 1) I tested/practiced my embouchure with the neck removed and had no problem producing a consistent sound. And 2) the octave key not only functioned much better, but it had a rubber covering on top of the pin key that the 1st one didn't have!!<br /><br />All of the moving parts felt cleaner, tighter, and smoother on the replacement. Honestly makes me wonder if it was damaged in transit, if the original one was an un-serviced return that had been damaged, or if it was a refurbished one that I was sent by accident.<br /><br />For my first saxophone, I'm enjoying it for what it is.

5.0,"portable, great voice quality, multiple useful accessories included, nice design","It has been a great product. I wanted a wireless microphone that can be connected with some source of portable speaker to overcome my voice limit due to wearing mask amid COVID-19 when lecturing in my classes. Therefore, I needed a wireless microphone that has to satisfy two requirements: (1) be able to capture my voice well from the front side of the mask or be small enough to be stuck in between my mouth and mask and (2) be able to connect wirelessly to a portable speaker that can amplify my voice. This microphone set works like a charm for both requirements. Note that some microphones are not sensitive enough to capture voice well. I bought a Karaoke microphone with speaker attached and it could not capture my voice well. My students didn't like it. This set has multiple microphones with different sizes and shapes for multiple uses. The overhead microphone worked for me when I could stick the microphone in between my mouth and mask. The receiver was then connect with my D8 Mini speaker through Aux line. Voila !! I wore it during my last classes and the students liked it very much, especially when I turned my back to them to write on the board and they could still hear me although I was wearing my mask. The pictures show how I connected the microphone to the D8 Mini speaker. Thumps up for this set. Highly recommended.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715eioYyI1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715eioYyI1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715eioYyI1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lKsaT-dZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lKsaT-dZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lKsaT-dZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B082KGC61N,B0BQYH4Y5L,AEXAEQJPK3WBX7AXXNJN7YP6JGAA,1598215326398,42,True,2020-08-23 20:42:06.398

3.0,"Lots of design advantages, but very noisy.","I love the portability of this rack, along with the fit and finish of the mechanical design. It's an amazingly compact, simple device that is mechanically well-thought-out and quite nice to look at. You will have to patch your own signal chain (there are no switches connecting the slots to one another without XLR cables), but this isn't really a downside in my opinion.<br /><br />The disappointing thing about this rack is that its promotional material boasts about its ""no noise power supply."" This is false advertising, because a) such a thing does not and cannot exist when there's a need to convert AC to DC power and b) this is a particularly noisy design, given that 120V, 60Hz AC power runs so close to unshielded, exposed XLR signal wires underneath the hood. Practically, there is 60Hz hum bleeding through all over the place, and the closer the slot you're using is to the wall plug on the back of the unit, the worse it gets. Many competitive racks use outboard AC/DC converters to skirt this issue by physically separating the AC power from the signal path. Lindell ""went for it"" and put the AC circuitry right next to the rack slots to keep the design compact... which would be fine if the power supply was actually shielded from the signal wires. It is not.<br /><br />Perhaps this wouldn't be a huge deal if you're dealing with a use case where less than about 30dB of gain is needed, but when the gain gets high, especially for amplifying quiet dynamic mics like the SM7, the 60Hz wall hum is extremely annoying. To get rid of it, you need to buy shielding metal and build a faraday cage around the AC power circuitry. If you're not willing to spend the extra $30 and 2 hours to do this, proceed with caution.<br /><br />It's very strange to me that Lindell hasn't solved this problem with a simple stamped metal enclosure. The noise issue is well documented on DIY audio forums, and occurs even when the unit is used with properly grounded home wiring.",[],B00GWM51IQ,B00GWM51IQ,AHIE4CMJBY2S2T3TODKMZUXMIZ2Q,1614023038573,3,True,2021-02-22 19:43:58.573

5.0,Fantastic performance.  Much better than the more expensive model from SONLY.,"Here's what I wrote for the ECM-CS10 review:  I bought this ECM-CS10 to use with a Zoom H1. I also bought, to compare, the ECM-CS3, which is less than half the cost of the 10. While the 10 may have some features that are better than the 3, I cannot discern them. As a notable downside, the recording level at the same gain setting in the H1 for the 10 is just far lower while the ECM-CS3 records an audio level (with settings the same on H1) that is much more workable in terms of volume level. I am planning to use the lapel mic system with the Zoom H1 when I give talks that I want to record my voice in a consistent manner rather than having the zoom H1 mic recording from table top. So, I will put the Zoom H1 in my pocket and use the lapel mic. The sound on the ECMCS3 seems really superb to me, and the sound level is so much lower on the 10 that I think it's inadequate. I don't want to turn the gain up to 90 something on the H1 just to get a decent level to work with. So, better deal and better performance to me seems to the ECMCS3.<br /><br />Both these mics work with plug-n-power which is supplied by the Zoom H1. So, you do not need any extra battery box or other stuff to use this mic effectively with a Zoom recorder.",[],B0058MJX4O,B0058MJX4O,AHG4LTGRZIDRLPC6PZQ6JMTKXGNQ,1429554013000,2,True,2015-04-20 18:20:13.000

3.0,"Nice starter Uke if you have a proper ""setup"" performed.","I bought this from a music store and have been playing it for a couple of months now.<br />Likes:<br />- Nice looking, and the tenor size fits me well as I am a big guy.<br />- I like the looks and the brighter sound of the spruce top.  I considered a mahogony tenor, but the spruce top sounded clearer and brighter to me, with more projection (louder).<br />- Quality of build is decent for an entry level uke.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- The 1 3/8"" neck width at the nut, is a bit narrow for me, making it very hard to get a good ""D"" chord.  After playing this a while, I think I prefer a radiused fingerboard or a 1 1/2"" nut width.  Personal preference.<br />- When tuning the open strings, I find the Uke is not in tune as you go up the neck.  Notes are sharp, which makes chords a bit out of tune.<br />Summary:<br /> If you purchase this, make sure the store has an on staff Luthier who will perform a full setup of the Uke before it is sent to you. (What is a ""setup""?  It is the final inspection that is not performed in most of the overseas factories that produce these instruments.  This is where the instrument is checked out to insure there are no defects, that frets are sanded level so the Uke stays in tune as you go up the neck, and all sharp edges removed and the string height is properly set so the Uke is easy to play.). Without this final setup, getting a decent quality Uke is a bit of a crap shoot.

5.0,Very satisfied so far,"I am a total amateur, playing in a band with some friends just for the fun. After 2 years I decided to have my own amp for rehearsal and gigs so spent a very good amount of time doing the research.

Orange seemed to have a little more punch than the Fender but since a live in a second floor without elevator, I had to take in account the weight to carry every week, and the this one is a third of the Orange, what I admit was the key factor. For my ears, sound is crispy, clear, punchy enough for what I'm playing - pop, rock, punk -, and the eq's and overdrive knobs are capable to provide a good range of sounds without the need of pedals - although keep using for certain effects. My band is kind of loud so I play at minimum at 12', but with the right adjustment I can get the the sound blending perfectly with the rest of the instruments.<br /><br />After one week playing my amp just stopped to work.

4.0,Tenor Mouthpiece on Mello?,"As a marching band section leader I went looking for a mouthpiece that would give my section a better sound. As the Mello 6 mouthpieces often limits our sound and tone color. I was reading many articles and sources on what mouthpiece fits best on mellophone. The blessing 5 popped up multiple times so i ordered it.<br /><br />The blessing 5 has a much bigger diameter than stock mellophone mouthpieces, and also has a very deep cup. My range was cut about 4 half steps, but that encouraged me to build my range. After 2 weeks I managed to play the notes I used to play on a Mello 6. But going back to the mello 6 mouthpiece to play, my range improved significantly. The sound of the mellophone comes out... broader. You get a bigger sound, and sounds dark, almost like a actual tenor horn. Not for a beginner.<br /><br />In a ensemble with a marching band. It begins to decline. Pitch on this mouthpiece proves to be a challenge, as you are usually flat even if you are pushed in, especially in the upper range. You stick out from the rest of section and sounds rather blatty on the field. You don't get the tradition 12 man mellophone sound with 1 mellophone soundling like a tenor horn. However, when it comes to mid to low runs, it sounds very nice.<br /><br />With a lot practice, you can get a really nice sound with this mouthpiece. Pitch, and high register is a issue, but is overcomable.

This was not a problem with regard to the threads...  The threads fit perfectly within the microphone.  Rather, the female end of the microphone was shallow compared to the depth/height/thickness of the bolt.  When the bolt was fully screwed into the microphone, there was about 1/8"" inch of gap between the bottom of the microphone and the top of the mount, which resulted in the microphone ""wobbling"" back and forth on the mount.  I suppose this could have been rectified by additional foam padding on the bottom of the mount, but no additional foam was shipped with the mount.

5.0,Love my Namesake,"My name is Tobias and they call me Toby.  So you know I could not resist picking this up just for kicks and grins. :P<br /><br />Turns out to be one of the best purchases of the year.  The reviews were spotty but given the reason above, I went for it anyway.  It was a clear, sunny day when it was delivered and I decided to unbox it right on the porch and check it out before going inside.<br /><br />Holy Cows!  I immediately decided that it would be my ""guitar"" of basses.  I sat down and started playing it and felt like I had been playing it all my life already.  Unlike any other bass I've had, this one fell right into my fingers.  I knew some intonation and other setup would be required, but for playability; it was right from day one.<br /><br />I've been happy.  But with that said, the only drawback is the electronics, which are a little on the weak side.  But they had to save money somewhere right?  I'm fine with it because it's nothing a little outboard processing (which as a guitar player, I do have plenty) couldn't compensate for.  Also, I've been playing ""Active"" basses for about 30 years now and so this is the first ""Passive"" bass I've had since my teen years.<br /><br />I have already used it for a few studio projects through a Boss GT-1B and been able to provide the needed sound along with some playing my people forgot I could give them. lol  It's a pretty good reminder of how important it is to have something you feel good playing.  You can make it sound however you want nowadays, but it's little good to you if you can't play it the way you want to.  And for the price, I can always throw some EMGs on it if I really feel like I need that Active Bass sound.  But meanwhile, both ""Tobys"" will stay as they are.

1.0,Durability fail!,One side stopped working after 8 months of use. I had high expectations when it came to durability on these but they failed short. I can only hear sound out of the headphone that the chord is connected to now. It seems as if the wiring within the headband has an issue.<br /><br />I was using the pioneer hdj2000's for 6 years and  had no issues until the wiring withing the head band also failed. So I decided to try the HD8's. If I knew they would fail within 8 months I would have never bought them. I keep the HD8s in the case they came in when I'm not using them. The pioneer's where never in a case and always thrown in my backpack. I'm surprised they lasted that long.<br /><br />Now I have to go through the hastle of checking the warranty on them and most likely sending them in to get fixed.<br /><br />I gig 3-4 times per week so this is definitely inconvenient.

4.0,Pricey but solid,"I have only 4 guitars to for my hanger.  However,  2 are fairly hefty solid bodies.  The frame alone is very solid. and the hangers are strong.  Fully extended hangers extend a good distance from the wall.  They do adjust though providing the ability to display your instruments in a variety of angles.  The success you have with this depends largely on how well it is mounted to your wall.  The frame is 48 inch long.  However studs are 16 inches apart.  In my case I had a rather narrow wall with a heater vent running up between two studs and a door on one end.  I was actually fortunate for the studs on either side of the heater because I don't know that this would line up at standard stud distance.  Getting this in position for 6 of the 8 screws was tricky.  It appeared to me that the online install video only used 6 screws.  I recommend you do some planning and identify where you want to mount this and make sure of the location of your well studs before you buy.  At the end of the day this is a nice looking way to mount your instruments for easy access.  It wasn't until after I had mine mound and had my guitars hung that I appreciated the expense.

If you have your kid on the other side of your mansion and they are playing with toys... this might pick it up. All joking aside though, it is too sensitive to be of practical use to a normal person. I have gone out and dropped several hundred dollars on ""extras"" such as covers, adjustable table arms, software to try and control the keyboard noises coming through and it still just captures everything. If you want the other person to hear everything that is going on around you to include scratching, moving your chair, typing, clicking on your mouse, sometimes their own voice because this will detect the noise from you headphones, or even breathing if you don't have the proper external extensions then this is the mic for you.

3.0,"Ok shofar, produces 1.5 notes and I found a way to get rid of the smell","This is my first shofar so take what I say with a grain of salt. With that said here is my review.<br /><br />-Dimensions-<br />Overall length is @ 22&#34; long<br />Bell is about 2 3/4&#34; wide<br />Mouth piece is 5/8&#34;<br /><br />So far the shofar (pun intended) produces one note and possibly two. I used to play the trombone in middle school but its really hard to get another note. Its nicely polished on the outside however after opening up the package I was met with a horrible smell. Honestly it smelled like bad goat arse. It was the worst smell I have experienced in a long time. The smell was so bad we could not leave the shofar in the house (we put it in the garage). So with that said I immediately looked online for a way to get rid of the smell.<br /><br />The smell is probably the one thing people have problems with so I tried the following...<br /><br />1. Vinegar method: Pour vinegar into the shofar. Close up both ends, shake the shofar for about 5 minutes. Pour out liquid, rinse and allow to dry naturally. Do this 2X.<br /><br />RESULT: Did this 2X and it did not help.<br /><br />2. Hydrogen peroxide method: Plug the shofar mouthpiece, fill it halfway with hydrogen peroxide. Close up both ends, shake the shofar for about 5 minutes. Pour out liquid, rinse and allow to dry naturally. Do this 2X.<br /><br />RESULT: it worked a little bit but not enough - still had to store it in the garage; after blowing it a few times the smell still made you ill.<br /><br />3. Odor neutralizer spray: PureAyre - filled up the shofar with 70% PureAyre and 30% warm water. Close up both ends, shake the shofar for about 5 minutes. Pour out liquid, rinse and allow to dry naturally. Do this 2X.<br /><br />RESULT: Took a little of the smell away but still bad<br /><br />4. Baking soda method: Dissolved about 4 heaping spoonfuls of baking soda in warm water and pour into shofar. Close up both ends, shake the shofar for about 5 minutes. Pour out liquid, rinse and allow to dry naturally. Do this 2X.<br /><br />RESULT: This is the one treatment that actually worked for us - the smell is almost totally gone and we can now keep the shofar in the house.<br /><br />With that said, if I was going to buy another shofar (and I probably will) I would get with the seller and have them test it over the phone so I could see if it sounded good, produced a few+ notes, etc. Food for thought.<br /><br />Since we can only get about 1.5 notes out of the shofar we won't be able to use it for the trumpet blasts on Rosh Hashana (feast of trumpets).",[],B00H7HRL4C,B00H7HRL4C,AHKSUSIGMLUPGJDOOGDXEGRIAIKA,1413133819000,10,True,2014-10-12 17:10:19.000

5.0,Puresound wires; Restoring the sound of a 1938 Radio King,"I've had a 6.5 x 14 inch 1938 Radio King snare for almost twenty years; it is a players drum's and not a collector piece. It came to me in a highly abused state yellowed, cigarette burned and cracked white marine pearl wrap, heavily taped heads along with snares taped to the bottom. Rims were cracked and pitted, to some a basket case. On further inspection beyond cosmetics, all of the critical parts; three-point strainer, engraved snare gates, muffler etc. were intact. Initially I removed the wrap, cleaned up the nickel parts, straightened bent metal and replaced the unsalvageable rims with Slingerland stick savers. Instead of re-wrapping the drum I kept the shell in  natural maple. The shell is magnificent with stunning grain with areas of birds eye; true what they say about the exquisite quality of ""old wood"". All I do is apply Tung Oil once a year. The drum is everything that's been said about a RK, solid, fat back, sensitive, extremely articulate over a broad tuning range and I use it often in a jazz guitar trio. One item I've never felt right on the drum though has been the snares. They could have been the originals as they were the correct extended ones but like the drum were in serious need of repair. After a bit of solder, a lot of attempts at straightening with much expletives deleted throughout got them to a point where they worked with only one or two wires emitting an annoying rattle at exactly the wrong time. They were 20 strand wires and while they gave the drum a crisp and full snare sound, they needed to be replaced. About a year ago I was talking about the drum at a local shop, Rainbow Guitars in Tucson. Clay Reed the drum guru said ""most snare drums from that era used 12 strand wires or silk wound wires."" I always assumed 12 strand wires were from the realm of low end cheap student model drums and would not be as responsive and more take away from a good snare drum sound. Clay knows his stuff though and has never steered me wrong so on his recommendation I went for a set of Puresound 12 strand extended wires made for this era Radio King. The change in the sound with the Puresounds was nothing short of incredible. The drum was more open, responsive and at the same time there was a new and wonderful woody feel of the maple shell coming through that just wasn't there with the old 20 strand wires; after who knows how long a time suffering ""snare wire suffocation"" this old drum could breathe! After twenty years and who knows how many years before the drum came to me, it sounds, feels and plays like a Radio King must have in the late thirties, early forties.

4.0,"Sturdy and Real Instrument, Not a Toy","I chose this plastic ocarina over getting a clay one, because I have a high quality plastic Alto Baroque Recorder Flute (Yamaha).  The ocarina feels sturdy in a similar way and neither is likely to break during transport.  Both seem to have clear notes.  I tested the ocarina with my Seiko Tuner and found most of the notes were very on target.  Some of them I had to play them for a while to get them in range and to sound right, but then I had this learning process with the Recorder Flute too.  For some reason, the sharps/flats were easier to get right and the G note was the hardest to both finger and to get to sound right.  The sound lower notes sound pleasant and mellow.  The higher notes slightly shrill, but were getting smoother and clearer with my recent practice.  This ocarina is a real instrument and not a out of tune toy.  I give it four stars rather than five, because I think that the tuning and fingering could be a little easier, but for the price it is hard to beat.

5.0,"excellent playability and sound, great value","I bought this model and very impressed with the playability and sound. Even after a long break from playing, this instrument brought it all back and made it seem easy. Lots of controls but some of them don't have much impact on the sound, and I wish it had a setting to turn off the active pickups - perhaps it does but not that i have found yet. Small touch but the pickups have rounded cutouts that make them a good thumb rest - had it not had that the first thing i would have done would have been install a thumb rest but this didn't need it. Very nice instrument. No fret buzz for me and very clear and defined low B. Few instruments that I have had include the second octave fret, so if you are thinking of getting a 6, i don't think it's needed, you have the range on the G string to go all the way down the neck.

2.0,Poorly made replica,"While a nice reproduction of a Fender Mustang, this guitar has three major flaws:<br /><br />* Bridge is an extremely odd design that does not allow vertical adjustment of individual strings.<br />* There is no way to lower the bridge action as a whole.  It is already at rock bottom and the strings are still way too high.  I had to order a new standard bridge to replace the one that's on there.  It is the worst bridge design I've ever encountered.<br />* The fret edges are sharp and unfinished<br /><br />As it arrives the guitar is almost unplayable.  The bad bridge design makes the string action so high it actually sharpens the notes when played.  You will have to replace the bridge to get the guitar to work properly.  Except for the poor bridge design and unfinished fret edges, this is a decent guitar.  Unfortunately the bridge is the center of any guitar... and this one doesn't work.  I don't know why they decided to deviate from the standard Mustang / Jaguar bridge design.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* Gorgeous and flawless metal-flake candy-apple red finish<br />* Good heft and feel<br />* Tremolo works well<br />* Good basic sound and sustain.<br />* Good electronics<br /><br />Unless you mod guitars as a hobby, you may wish to pay the extra and buy an authentic Squier Mustang.  This guitar may work for you if you don't mind finishing fret edges (requires special tools), replacing pickups (the included pickups sound rather tinny) and buying a new bridge-- at which point you might still save a little money over the Squier  (but not much).",[],B00DKXXIF8,B00DKXXIF8,AFNOO5CWS6FB4PMBONLYRO5R6XGQ,1459047900000,2,True,2016-03-27 03:05:00.000

5.0,Awesome rapid-prototyping analog synth,"This product is seriously cool. So quick and easy to swap around the modules - actually easier than the typical method of using phono cords and jacking them in and out of modules. Great way to teach or learn about analog sound synthesis. Could make an excellent hands-on introduction to analog synths for the purpose of extending this knowledge to a wider platform, such as customizing instruments in Propellerhead's Reason music software.<br /><br />You can slap the keyboard into an oscillator, snap on the speakers, and (with the power module too) you've got music. Want a more complex sound, just snap another oscillator between the first one and the speaker. And maybe the filter. Want a sound that fades up, or attacks like a piano key? Add the envelope. You don't even need to know what any of them do, because the accompanying guide book starts with basic projects and builds up. With some quick explanations, but honestly just putting them together gives you a pretty good idea what they do (though I must admit to having prior experience).<br /><br />The only real point of dissatisfaction is that the keyboard is both very basic/klunky (due to having just normal button switches, not &#34;keys&#34; per se), and very short in range. Even reaching like half an octave more could make a difference.<br /><br />Also, some modules (like the filter) seem to get into a funky state from however it was previously used, and connecting to briefly to the trigger rather than the input seems to clear that up.<br /><br />It's amazing how fast you can get started, and how quickly you can alter your chain of modules (soooo quick...).

I would purchase from KLIQ again knowing they stand behind their products.  Please see my original review below especially if you play a harp as this may not be the tuner for you -<br /><br />I'm sure it works well enough depending on what you need it for but it wasn't a fit for me.  It does a lot of things but didn't do any one of them well enough for me to keep it.<br /><br />On the plus side it seems fairly intuitive and is an awfully cute shade of red in person.<br /><br />On the other hand, I cannot stand the harsh metallic beep of electronic metronomes.  An analog metronome or one of the dozens of metronome apps on your phone can create a much more pleasing tone.<br /><br />It was not able to &#34;hear&#34; the pitches of my lever harp well enough for me to tune it easily, especially in the higher pitches.

As is to be expected, there will be variations, and quality control isn't always 100% perfect, nor is shipping or stocking. That said...<br /><br />This item was a delightful surprise, from outer package to ring tone. The box is strongly constructed and nicely printed. Inside, the bowl is in a plastic bag, and included are a donut pillow, two mallets (one unfinished wood, one dark stained with leather wrapped end), a burlap carrying bag, an instruction booklet and the well made chakra bracelet which may or may not be made with semi-precious stones but the beads are at least lovely transparent glass. The bowl is small so the resonance isn't very long lasting, but the tone is clear and deep, I'm guessing a C, very peaceful. I chose the polished bowl, and the etched or dimpled surface bowls may offer different tonal qualities. And this was the first bowl ever I was able to ""sing"" using the plain mallet! (I wrapped the bracelet around the dark mallet as a decoration!)<br /><br />At this price I suggest you order two or more, choose the one that resonates best with you, and return or gift the others.

2.0,It's a kid's guitar with many deal-breaker problems and disappointments.,"It's a kid's guitar with many disappointments (despite the many youtube videos raving about it). Fewer frets. Tremolo bar in the way and too high and too loose. (Buy special spring for the screw hole to tighten.) Volume control in the way. Floating bridge in the way. Pickups too high: Pick hits the treble/rear one. Just so badly designed / engineered. 10-48 gauge strings require three springs and tightening the internal bridge spring screws. Frets too high. Action to high. Hurts finger tips. It's a kid's learning guitar and not so good for that either.<br /><br />No neck varnish and very bad instructions which must have been written in China. For example, it instructs you to insert BOTH ends of the cable into the AMPLIFIER. They call the ends ‚Äújack male‚Äù and ‚Äújack female‚Äù. This language has so many things wrong with it. Overall, the instructions TO SET UP THE GUITAR appear very complex and definitely not for beginners, using words I never heard of before. Very frustrating. They provide a third spring with NO instructions for its use and NO instructions for using heavier gauge strings. Instructions say the floating tremolo can be adjusted to a flat position or ‚Äúremain floating on the body‚Äù, but they don‚Äôt tell you what or why to do either one or what that means. Etc., etc., etc. I guess I‚Äôll be playing Mostly my Mosrite. (Thank G√òD there are YouTube videos that will help with this Squire setup!) But having changed the strings, it‚Äôs STILL unplayable. You can‚Äôt just change the strings and think that‚Äôs all there is to it. There‚Äôs a complex procedure (on Youtube) for getting the tremolo bridge to lie ‚Äúflat‚Äù. And what the heck is ‚Äúdiapason‚Äù? They say, ‚ÄúFirst, make sure the locking nut is loose‚Äù. WHAT ‚Äúlocking nut‚Äù??<br />All of this is shocking for a famous guitar company like Fender.

3.0,Very Bright. Direct light has a purple glow which ruins the magic a little. Confusing to operate,"Black light leds don't really work well in general. They're, in part, ultraviolet, but not without giving off a lot of just plain old violet light. These lights are extremely bright and will fluoresce neon colored items well outside of their direct vicinity. That means you can hide the glaringly obvious purple light behind something and make some colors glow in the peripherals. You will not get that classic 80's haunted house feel of ""look at the lint in my cheap hoodie glow... look at your funky glowing yellow teeth!"" I mean white cotton items will glow, but more so because you're shining purple light on them, they're not fluorescing a visible light wave from an invisible one.<br /><br />They are a very nice dark purple. This light alone could be utilized in a haunted house or at a party for a scenic effect. If you a good purple light, these are great.<br /><br />The housing and electronics are clearly made for RGB leds. A group of these leds are tied to each color channel. Setting red, blue, or green to max will turn on a series of these lights. To get them all on you need to set each color channel to max. There are no colors, to be clear, it's just how the the remote is labeled. If you use the color chase feature, you can get three series of these lights fading in and out at different times, which is a neat unintentional effect.<br /><br />The housings are very cheap plastic. These are not intended to be used outside and, just in case you were considering it anyway, these are very not waterproof. They do feature DMX, which is odd. If you're using these in a theater with a computerized lighting board or, more appropriately, a dj DMX console, these should work. I did not test the DMX features because I don't have a spare ETC lighting board kicking around.<br /><br />There are a lot of hieroglyphics on the remote that serve seemingly no purpose, but I think they're intended to be saved programs. Couldn't make much sense of the manual.<br /><br />If you have some time to play with them, and want a very bright purple light with some fluorescents off in the wings, these will work.

3.0,easy to set up and a lot of fun!,"My daughter and I have been having a ton of fun singing karaoke with this thing. It is very easy to use - you pair it with your device over Bluetooth (there are other options, like a USB, as well) and after that it automatically pairs with your device when you turn it on. The two wireless microphones need 2 AA batteries each, and they automatically pair to the karaoke machine when you turn them on.<br /><br />I paired it with my phone and first, but then switched to my iPad so that it was easier to see the lyrics. I just use Spotify and that displays synced lyrics for most songs. The sound quality is not great, I'll be honest, so if you want it to sound amazing this might not be the machine for you. That might be mostly the quality of the microphones, though, and you *can* plug in other mics so maybe that's an option. I do like that you can control the volume for the music and the microphones separately, but I have to turn up the volume almost all the way to hear the music at all, so you can't make the music that loud. There's also a knob for echo, which I keep at the lowest setting because it sounds pretty terrible with it on. You can advance songs from the machine as well, but since I have a device right next to it displaying lyrics, I don't really need that feature. I haven't tried other inputs but it seems pretty straightforward to set up and it comes with easy-to-follow instructions.<br /><br />At first I thought it wasn't really worth it to have a karaoke machine that didn't display the lyrics, but it really is more fun with the microphones and the lights and colors! You can also turn those off if you want. It seems to have pretty good battery life, we have used it a few times without charging it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jKmeRo-IL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jKmeRo-IL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jKmeRo-IL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BR9Y4SMK,B0BTD7Y85H,AG3CWEQVIMY46HOTRBCIIQNRUQ4Q,1675630272574,0,False,2023-02-05 20:51:12.574

5.0,Adequate and inexpensive alternative to K&K Pure Mini Acoustic Guitar Pickup,"I installed this on my Martin 00-15m the other night. The hole wasn't large enough for the pin so I had to drill a hole. I'm not great with these sort of things, so I thought I could whittle to make the whole larger, but I ended up drilling the hole. I started with a smaller drill bit and worked my way up each time to get it right. I finally got it right and I started to put the pin through the hole through the soundhole. This was difficult. The Martin is smaller than normal Dreadnought guitars, but I was finally able to get it in there.

I'm sure hot glue would have worked better, but I suppose the stickiness should hold for a long time. The wires then can be clamped together using the zip tie and a plastic holder (with a sticky bottom) so you can hold the wires away from the soundhole. It's a little confusing to explain, but using the video and taking your time, you should have no problem installing this on your own. Once I plugged it in and heard the sound I was damn impressed. I may pick up a few more of these for my ukulele and other guitars. The only thing I had to do was turn down the bass on my amp and it sounded just as good as my Dean Markley soundhole pickup (which doesn't fit the 00-15 so well, that's why I installed this.).<br /><br />It takes a few weeks to ship from China, but for the price, you cannot go wrong.",[],B00WW6TNXK,B00WW6TNXK,AFV5D7WYDUHGSFX3WBYRGRSIPHQQ,1461612700000,2,True,2016-04-25 19:31:40.000

5.0,Budget wireless lapel mic for video,"I am a music producer/audio professional who also creates video content online. I tend to be pretty skeptical when I see these cheaper ""knock-off"", no name tech brands on Amazon. But, I decided to take the risk with this XVIVE product after it was recommended to me by one of my musician friends. And I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I've been using a Rode shotgun mic on my Sony mirrorless camera for my YT videos for a couple years now, but I felt tied to my camera and felt that the audio quality varied depending on how close I was to the camera. Because of that I wanted to get a wireless on shirt lapel mic in hopes of getting a more consistent sound. I looked at options from some of the known professional audio brands but the price made me think twice. For less than 200$, this wireless lapel system is worth it. I'm not sure how long it'll hold up or how well it'll work if you need to be very far from the receiver, but for my in studio work it has performed very well.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Very easy to use.<br />-The transmitter and receiver connect instantly and don't need to be ""paired""<br />-The lapel mic itself seems like it's of good quality, and includes a locking screw which will prevent accidental unplugging.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-The build quality is a bit plasticky at first...

2.0,Save up and get something else.,"Don't do it... I know what you're thinking. 1000 watt 18 inch powered sub for 400 bucks! I don't do many reviews but this one I feel I need to do to the fact that I bought these based off all of the great reviews.<br /><br />I was helping my school with sound for a 600 seat auditorium. I don't have much experience with live sound, I'm a recording guy. Money is of course tight so I scoured the internet. I found these as we had bought cables from them before. For mains we have 4 QSC KW153s. These are not a cheap speaker, but the mids are exactly what you'd expect... no mud. These cabs have a 15"" that has 500 watts feeding them. The 15s actually did well but they didn't punch without clipping. So, subs right? OK, well if 4-15"" 500 watt are close, 4 18"" 1000 watt should do the trick. Nope. In fact 4 of these seemed about the correct match for 1 KW153. Oops. I was confused and thought maybe I had done something wrong. Tech support thought I wired it wrong, which I hadn't. They were able to clip, they had plenty of input. We even tried a DriveRack to be sure.<br /><br />Over the last weekend I had a rock concert in the venue. I did what I should have done before. I rented 4 QSC KW181s. These are 18"" 1000 watt subs. They are the match for the 153s and obviously more expensive than the Enforcers. I will say that they sound like 1000 watts. Honestly, if I wasn't told the Enforcers were 1000 watts I'd guess they were 250. Comparing them with 1 of the 181s I was able to hear it over the 4 Enforcers(all set to barely peak).

5.0,Great Cover! Worth buying.,"I read the reviews, saw a few people with complaints about the stretchy pieces falling apart.  I've had mine for a week and my thoughts are this.  For starts the cover is exactly what I needed for my new Yamaha MOX8, 88key workstation. It fits perfectly! The elastic makes it very simple to slip on one side then pull it across to the other. The cloth is very soft, definitely will not scratch anything. So nothing but PROS in terms of what it is designed to do, it does well. The CONS now: I do not expect this to last forever with daily use however. Anything that stretches will eventually need replaced. I could see if you were to take the cover on and off a few times a day, it would probably start to wear eventually especially in a dry environment. I keep humidity in my house at 50, so I don't think I'll have the issue for atleast over a year, but some people might. I play my piano once every night. I consider covers to be a consumable item that needs replaced as wear is noticed. But this shouldn't push you away from buying this. I had a plastic cover and I just didnt like it. This simply stores inside itself and has a little rope hangar so I hang it off my stand then unrope it and pull the cover out of the pouch and put it back on. Works great! Much better than tossing it on the floor. For the price, it is worth it!

There a sharp ends that slightly protrude from the fret board.  It's not enough to be a cut hazard but it is slightly uncomfortable.<br /><br />The amplifier has reasonable tone for the size of the speaker.  I played my HSS and SSS Strats and my Les Paul through the amplifier.  The sound was acceptable for a solid-state amplifier.

5.0,Great pick up with built in pre-amp,"I bought this pick up back in June (2016) and have used it for 6 months. I play with a small bluegrass band and plug it into a Fender 100 watt rumble, and in big venues I run a cable form the rumble to the board. I find that the pre-amp unit in the Myers pick up is plenty strong. In fact when I plug it into the rumble I have the gain set at 25% on the pick up. I have found that positioned directly over the F hole is a bit boomy of a sound unless I turn the gain down to 10% on the pickup, and turn the gain higher on the rumble. On the E string side I adjusted the lows down and the highs up on the amp. On the G string side I had the lows up and the highs way down and up until recently prefered the G-sting side. I recently found a video in a bassist website that showed jazz bassist Neal Minor using a Meyers pick up and it was placed just in front of the bridge, pointing right at the center of the sound board. I tried the pick up at that position and the sound was really even with the gain now turned up to 50%. I use the clamp as the suction cup wouldn't hold but it's so dry here in Nevada. I highly recommend this unit because of the sound, has a built in pre-amp, and the customer service is great. My wife bought one for her Martin guitar and Gregg worked with her to get the unit set up right for her at no extra charge.

4.0,Are you having trouble staying in tune?  Tune in to this!,"Are you having trouble keeping your guitar in tune, or are you tired of how long it takes to restring your guitar?  For me it was, both.<br /><br />The first time I bought a set of these was for a Line 6 Variaxe.  The guitar wouldn't stay in tune.  So I put these tuners on it but had to tap some tiny holes for the locating pin on the back of the tuners.  Problem fixed.<br /><br />The next 2 guitars were Fender Mexi-Telecasters.  They would slip after replacing the strings until they were taught.  The Fender Telecasters already had the locating holes so it was an easy replacement, it took maybe 15 mins to replace all of them.<br /><br />Another factor that made me want to replace the tuners with the locking tuners is because I read The American Deluxe Telecasters had locking tuners.  My American Deluxe Stratocaster comes with locking tuners and it's tuning is very stable.  (I'd say perfect but it does have a whammy bar.)<br /><br />I would give these tuners 5 stars but since they use the locating pin system, they lost the perfect rating due to the fact you have to drill holes into a non-Fender guitar.  But if it is a Fender they should fit perfectly.  I have read however not all model of Fenders use the locating pin system.

The super-long cord is way more than we need, but may be a plus for other users.

2.0,"Not True Sonic Blue, Great Guitar but get a Bullet Mustang you will be happier!","[[VIDEOID:30fa9140a5a7ce6def04b2cdd6e5943a]] Please read all the way through you will understand why I gave it 2 stars...<br /><br />I really really wanted to like the Classic Vibe Mustang in Sonic Blue. It's the ONLY Mustang on the market currently that has the Phase Switches instead of a 3 way toggle, not even the Fender Amercian Series has them! I picked my up at the local Sam Ash not Amazon but wanted to help anyone out who is on the fence and the Classic Vibe Series!! I have purchased a Squier Bullet Mustang off Amazon in the Imperial Blue and right out of the box the thing sounded amazing. The Classic Vibe Mustang on the other hand is a ""Faded Sonic Blue"" (Fenders color code 72 quick Google search) and the pickups on the one I own are not High Output Alnico Pickups!!!<br /><br />The Classic Vibe I own is completely stock and when plugged into any guitar amp the volume is extremely low. I thought maybe the small pots it comes with were the source, changed them to 250k CTS Offical Fender Parts with new capacitor in the tone still same issue. Next step is to change the pickup with a old Strat pickup I have to see if that works.<br /><br />The Money spent on a Classic Vibe Mustang is not worth the money. You will not be happy with the paint job unless you like the Faded look (which is more white with a very light blue hue) and will end up spending money on Neck Shims, Paint (Krylon ColorMaxx Gloss Blue Ocean Breeze and laquer), New Pickups, Full size Pots, Better Wire (Art of Tone) and know how to Solder of course and then you will have a great playing guitar! Dont think about adding Humbuckers unless you have a Router and Sheliding Paint. Or....<br /><br />Buy the Squier Bullet Mustang in any color you want and they have Bullet Mustang pickguards in all different pickup arrangements and you will have a great guitar that's stock out of the box way better than the Classic Vibe series. (I have 5 Bullet Mustangs currently!!) I would recommend changing the bridge saddles to the 10.5 mm with brass roller on it (easy mod to do) and you wallet will thank you and you will spend a lot less money, time and frustration with a better sounding guitar!!! You can buy 2 different Squier Bullet Mustangs compared to 1 Squier Classic Vibe and you will be a lot happier with the decision I promise you!!! The neck on the Bullet is a lot thinner and faster even though it's a satin finish not a glass finish like the Classic Vibe. The Classic Vibe does have a fuller felling to the neck and has the better ""Mustang"" logo font. Unless you find a 2017/2018 Bullet Mustang all the logo fonts on the Bullets are very small and generic. You could always check into water slides go to Micheals and refinish your neck to get the cool font on your headstock!",[],B07N2939RC,B07N2939RC,AH2IGNRPNCVDZH3RZLOHZG3Y5OOA,1653241519656,2,False,2022-05-22 17:45:19.656

4.0,Almost Perfect,"I'm going to keep this review simple and not talk every single feature this controller has. There's enough articles and videos out there already to cover that. Instead, I will cover all the lesser talked about things in this review.<br /><br />To start off, let's talk about assembling the thing. There isn't much too it; all you have to do is screw the platters in then the slipmats and vinyls. No extra tools are necessary as they're all included in the box. The only slightly difficult part is aligning the screw on the securing center bracket with the notch in the spindle. If you did it right, you'll hear a &#34;click-clack&#34; sound as you move the record back and forth with the screw loosely tightened. Now screw it tighter until the sound goes away. Don't push down on the record during installation otherwise it'll apply too much pressure to the slipmat and you won't be able to pull off more difficult scratching & turntablism techniques. Just let it rest lightly before tightening the screw. You can also take apart the bracket and attach it to any 7&#34; record you'd like. Of course, this is entirely for show, as this controller doesn't play actual vinyl on its own.<br /><br />Now let's address some concerns. First off, the resolution of the pitch sliders. They're only accurate down to 0.05 BPM. Now that might not sound like a big deal, but even if the BPM meter on the mixer indicates that they're matched, during any mix longer than 16-32 beats the tracks will start to drift apart on you, forcing you to use pitch bend or get the hang of nudging records the old-fashioned way. Now if you're coming from vinyl this is a non-issue for you, but those of you upgrading from jogwheels will practically have to learn how to beatmatch all over again. Of course, if you're a SYNC DJ, you can ignore everything I just said in this paragraph, as none of it applies to you. Or if you're like me, you don't mind at all because it only adds to the experience of feeling like you're mixing on vinyl. You can also turn the motors off completely and use the platters as normal jogwheels should you choose, which makes them work like a CDJ with the jogwheels in CD mode.<br /><br />Second concern has to do with the Line, Phono, and Mic inputs: they're too damn quiet. Even with the gain cranked, the inputs are about 10% as loud as Serato. And when it comes to Phono, there is an audible hum even with nothing connected to the input at all. (EDIT: This issue appears to have been fixed in the latest Serato update. Phono hum has been almost completely eliminated) You will also need a preamp for your mic. CDJs, iPods, and phones can get by with using just the Line inputs, so long as you crank the gain. And since the mixer uses a Full EQ, you can also turn up the bass, mid, and treble by the same amount to get a little extra gain. (EDIT: I believe this issue has been fixed as well, but I haven't had the chance to test it yet. Will update review when I get the chance.)<br /><br />To clarify, this controller doesn't support DVS, so the only thing the mixer can be used for is oldschool vinyl mixing when a turntable is connected (UPDATE: As of August 10, 2015, DVS is officially supported on the NS7 II. You'll need to update Serato DJ to 1.7.6 or higher and buy the $99 DVS expansion kit. Personally I haven't tested it yet). Effects and the Filter knob are performed in Serato, so they don't work with external devices (EDIT: not sure if they'll work when in DVS mode). The only mixer functions that work when a external device is connected are gain, EQ, upfaders, and the crossfader. The VU meters work too, thankfully.<br /><br />Onto the Filter knobs: the center notch wears out WAY too quickly. I've had this controller for barely a month and the notches on channels 1 & 2 are already starting to show signs of wear, especially when compared to the knobs on lesser-used 3rd and 4th channels. I imagine I will have to replace them after about a year. Hopefully it's a user-serviceable part. (EDIT: It's not.. well, at least not as easy to replace as the crossfader. You need to take apart the entire controller to access the filter knobs.)<br /><br />Oh and another minor concern has to do with the mirrored decks. It's really weird at first. I still occasionally find myself reaching for the wrong side of the deck when working on the left side. It definitely takes some time getting used to. (EDIT: I'm used to it now)<br /><br />Those of you complaining about the Needle Drop/Strip Search function are probably doing it wrong. You're supposed to tap it, not slide your finger across it.<br /><br />The MPC pads feel kind of stiff, and have no click to them at all. They feel akin to the Rock Band drumset if you know what that feels like, except more sturdy. They're not very sensitive either, even in velocity sensitive mode. While this prevents accidental activation, you have to give them a good solid tap for them to activate. If they were larger I'd pull the drumsticks out of storage. That said, they've always recognized my input when I've intentionally hit them. So long as you don't have the strength of a toddler you can still pull off rapid-fire finger drumming on them.<br /><br />All in all, despite my complaints, I'd still say this is one of the best controllers ever made. It's an absolute blast to mix on and loaded with features that'll have you coming up with every excuse you can to mix. If you want the feel of vinyl without having to give up on all the benefits of a controller, you can't go wrong with an NS7 II. Otherwise, if you don't care for motorized platters you'll probably want a Pioneer DDJ-SX2 or DDJ-SZ instead. But if you have your heart set on an NS7 II, don't pay full price for one. I was lucky enough to get a new unit from Amazon Warehouse Deals for $900. Personally I wouldn't spend more than $1000 on one.<br /><br />Now for some TIPS & TRICKS:<br />First off, let's take a look at some settings in Serato. On the first tab, DJ Preferences, check the box for &#34;Show beat Jump Controls&#34;. Now when you put your MPC pads in Auto/Roll mode the last four pads can be used to seamlessly jump around in the song. Perfect for remixing on the fly, skipping boring parts, or extending the outro because you need more time to find the perfect tune to mix in next!<br /><br />On the same screen you'll also want to enable &#34;Instant Doubles&#34;. This'll allow you to copy a track to the other deck for easy beat juggling and whatnot. You'll also want to change the &#34;Virtual Deck Speed&#34; to 45 RPM because after all, this controller fits 7&#34; 45s. (EDIT: Turns out there's a bug at 45RPM that causes songs to randomly play way too fast or way too slow with extreme pitch changes (more than +/- 30%). The problem is eliminated at 33RPM, so I switched back to that speed.)<br /><br />On the mixer tab you have the option to change the upfader curve since unlike the crossfader, it the controller doesn't have its own upfader curve knob. It's set to Slow (logarithmic) by default, but personally I prefer more linear upfaders, so I set it to the middle.<br /><br />Now on the main screen, click the &#34;My Serato&#34; button on the bottom right corner. Then click &#34;Expansion Packs & Activations&#34;. Create a Serato account if you haven't already, and this'll give you access to the Wolf Pack effects pack for free. It contains the very useful Echo Out effect, along with a bunch of other fun new effects as well. If you use Master Tempo, I'd also suggest buying the Pitch 'n Time DJ expansion, which will let you change the tempo by more than 6-8% without distorting the sound.<br /><br />Oh and you can also use Virtual DJ with this controller but I'd recommend Serato DJ instead since it comes free with the controller. No need to register or anything, just install, turn on your controller, and go. Even if you bought your controller used SDJ will still work for free. Don't waste your time with cracked copies of VDJ, because this controller is one of the few that won't work with them.<br /><br />Finally, one thing I noticed is that Serato's auto-gain algorithm doesn't seem to work as well as VDJ's, so I'd recommend using MP3Gain to normalize all your tracks. Be sure to set the Target Volume to 92 dB, as I've found that the default 89 dB is too quiet. Also, because Serato DJ still doesn't have key detection, you'll need a third-party app to handle that. I'd recommend using KeyFinder since it's completely free and its key detection is second best to the legendary (and expensive) Mixed in Key. Now right-click the Artist/Title/BPM bar in Serato and check the box to display the key, and you're all set. (EDIT: As of version 1.8, Serato now has key detection, as well as key shifting if you have Pitch 'N Time.

5.0,Very good all-in-one tool,I used the 90 degree side to file the frets flush to the fingerboard. It worked great albeit a little slow on medium jumbo stainless steel frets. Very ergonomic in the 90 degree position. It also works great in the 35 degree position but is slightly more awkward to use.

5.0,EXCELENT.,"I've read some of the reviews.  Some folks have had issues with 'hiss'?  Other negative issues also...  I've had the original Nady-Pro system back in the late 70's.  They were the first on the market.  All the rock-stars used the VHF Nady models...  They were about $700+ - way back then... I bought the FM Nady unit, which was in the $400 range...  THIS SYSTEM BLOWS THE OLD NADY'S AWAY!  TOTALLY...  - No hiss whatsoever; with multiple amp brands/models.  The big thing -  SOUND QUALITY!  - EXCELLENT.  ""AS GOOD AS CORDED"".  And I've been playing electric guitars for over 40 years - Rock-N-Roll.  I even build and work on guitars (Luthier).  For $40 bucks, these units are excellent.  Good battery life.  They take about an hour to charge.  Very good wireless range.  Quiet.  Sound is as good as corded.  You know, I can't really ask for more...  My old Nady wireless, which I used a lot, really messed with my sound.  Not even close to corded.  But, it was the only thing available at that time, in the late 70's...  The VHF was too pricey for me, but, I think it had better sound... That's what the rock stars were using...  All I can say, is, I got a good pair.  And I would highly recommend this brand and model/system.  I use these transmitters every day.  They are really impressive.  And no 'telescopic' antenna either, like the old systems...  I'm very impressed! :)",[],B08NYJQVBT,B09DVHGJSG,AFIR2TAU7KXQN6WNTLKRHLFCQ3PQ,1651599150771,5,True,2022-05-03 17:32:30.771

5.0,The perfect second violin,"Incredibly well-made for the price, this Vif BV250 offers a strong bass and treble while the heavy lacquer reduces the midrange frequencies quite a bit. This makes it sound somewhat hollow, but that clears room in the ensemble for the first violins to sing over. Thus this is the perfect cheap second violin for a quartet, and you might like the tone beyond that.<br /><br />The bridge was well fitted but poor, the soundpost arrived up but about 2mm from the optimum placement and with a poor fit, so you will want a luthier to help get the most out of this. The strings are ok to start with but the bow should be marked ‚Äúemergency use only‚Äù and replaced with a carbon fiber without delay. Don‚Äôt judge the sound of anything with the included bow and rosin.<br /><br />The case is a nice touch at this price, fits well and roomy, with the entire top a pocket. Pegs didn‚Äôt need much work and I actually really like the tailpiece, adds some bass resonance well. Handsome and solid, fingerboard was just about flawless, nut was fine, really the soundpost was the only urgent issue. And it was passable anyway to start with.<br /><br />I can‚Äôt think of a reason not to get one of these if only for the outdoor gigs and second fiddle opportunities. Head and shoulders above the other beginner violins in the price range, and several of those may actually be this same model but with a setup and accessories added. Get an even better setup with your local luthier and pick your own accessories.",[],B0109XX7Z2,B0109XX7Z2,AFXVMXIAMROWJSIZ2IQBTX2GF4LA,1606355054522,1,True,2020-11-26 01:44:14.522

It is performing beautifully.....tracking nicely.....and was easy to install.  All my old albums play just a well as before....even the slightly warped ones.

5.0,Fits Indio HSS Strat with some minor Dremel work,"First and foremost, depending on the type of Strat you own, this pickguard may need some modification work in order to fit, especially if you're converting from a different pickup combination (whether SSS, HSS, etc.). There's just no getting around it. If you're not competent with tools or minor DIY work, you may want to have a skilled luthier or an experienced wood worker do the work for you. Some fenders will also need the body cavity routed out in order to accommodate 2 humbucker pickups, especially if you're converting a single-coil 3-pickup Strat (SSS) to dual humbucker (HH). If your Strat needs body cavity modification and routing, that will definitely involve more labor and skill.<br /><br />I purchased the black pearl colored 4-ply pickguard for an Indio HSS Strat...wanted to convert it from HSS to HH. Indio guitars are more or less Fender Squier clones (they're not an exact match but very close), and IMO are better quality than some Fender Squier models. Additionally, Indio guitars have plenty of room in the cavity underneath the pickguard for easily installing HH pickups near the bridge and neck (see photo) without the need to do any additional routing work. The pickguard is well-made, sturdy, and easily modified if you have a Dremel or small routing tool.<br /><br />For my particular (formerly HSS config) Indio Strat, I had to use a Dremel w/sanding bit to thin out area of the pickguard that butts up against the trem block (bridge), as well as removing some material from the rear of the pickguard that snugs up underneath the neck. As you can see in the photo, it's far from a perfect job, but looks cosmetically acceptable now that there is clearance around the trem block. You should be able to see the material I've removed if you compare my photo to the stock pickguard w/no modifications. Only a couple of the screw holes on the pickguard lined up - just lock those 2 holes down and use a small drill bit to drill pilot holes using the pickguard as your guide. It's very easy and took under 20 minutes to fully modify.<br /><br />Overall the pickguard looks great, and I like the black pearl look compared to the plain colors. Goes well with the royal blue color of the guitar. The back side of the pickguard has plenty of shielding on it to minimize interference. Great price and I highly recommend for anyone looking to convert their Strat to dual humbucker or replace an existing HH pickguard.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w24+SxSEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w24+SxSEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w24+SxSEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07G9Y63K3,B07KP4QKQ4,AFRFK5DJ6RHQNGHHEMJ3M3KWE2XQ,1584136840187,0,True,2020-03-13 22:00:40.187

5.0,"nice sounding, but not the best looking","It's been over 20 years since I picked up a violin. As a kid, my parents put me through 6 years of weekly violin lessons, which I hated. However, I miraculously made my way through the suzuki grading system and passed grade 8 on the volin. Those volins that I grew up with were all couple grand violins, and are now a continent away. Fast forward 20 years, not sure why, but I decided to pick this one up from Amazon to play some of suzuki's pieces for fun, and maybe pick up violin playing again.<br /><br />This violin is not very pretty, workmanship looks so so, but once the strings (that came with it) are tuned correctly, this violin does sing very nicely. It has a very sound to it. Nothing cheap sounding, or loud and empty sounding. Note that of course the sounds a violin makes depends on more factors than just the violin, the bowing technique, and also the finger pressing technique, but this violin is worth every dollar I've spent on it.<br /><br />Of course buying from Amazon is always a pleasure. Quick one day shipping, secure packaging, no worries purchase. I'm so happy with this buy. Practicing on it just makes my heart feel so happy. Thanks for reading.<br /><br />Another quick note, the bow needs lot and lots of resin initially, so don't think it's broken when you try to bow and the sound is horrible, just be patient and give it more resin.

Yes, it does have a slight tilt back (if you push it that way! who does that?) because it has hinges to fold it up. It lays the laptop in a downward angle so the weight it going down and towards the DJ. I'm wondering, what in the world are they doing to push their laptop backwards?

5.0,Hey! Listen!,"No, really, listen. This instrument is enchanting. Melodic doesn‚Äôt come close. It‚Äôs truly breathtaking.<br />This is my second Ocarina, the first being a more expensive (and overpriced in my opinion) plastic STL Ocarina, which this one beats hands down. Not only is this not made of plastic but unlike my STL ocarina, this one has no trouble hitting the high notes- and I don‚Äôt even have to do the acute bend! The breath control is so much easier on this lovely piece and the instrument itself is simply gorgeous.<br /><br />I was delighted to open my box to an Ocarina that has a slightly lighter tone than the one the picture shows, the blue is more of a robin egg or light teal that my horrible camera doesn‚Äôt give the justice it deserves.<br /><br />My only real disappointment was in the songbook- which I think is a bit unfair of me. My problem was all my own fault, I‚Äôd gotten excited seeing that there was twenty songs included and for some reason assumed they‚Äôd be in sheet music style. The twenty songs are there but are in Ocarina tabs- which is perfect for anyone who is just starting out or if this is their first instrument. With this lovely little songbook even someone who has never seen a piece of sheet music in their life would be able to play a little ditty on their ocarina with no problem since the tabs show you exactly which holes need to be covered for the desired note. As someone who is just learning sheet music and hungry for any I can get my hands on the tabs did make me a little sad, but this feature truly just makes the product even better for those who‚Äôve never played before so I can‚Äôt blame them.<br /><br />The Ocarina also comes with a pretty little cord to attach and a nicely padded protective bag.<br /><br />I must say the cord scares me a little, the piece that you tie to the ocarina just seems so thin I‚Äôm afraid to trust it (especially with my knotting skills). That being said I‚Äôve decided not to rely on it overly much. I‚Äôve attached it with a little prayer that if my hands let the ocarina slip from them the strap will hold and save this precious little instrument from shattering on the ground. Other than in hopefully-never-to-be drops I‚Äôll not be using the strap as a necklace. I‚Äôll wear it as I play in case I do drop it, but I‚Äôm not going to be wearing the ocarina around in that fashion. For the record, the strap is adjustable and it fits over even my big head.<br /><br />If you decide not to trust the strap (or the knot you tie for that matter (: ) but still wish to carry the ocarina around on your person the handy dandy pouch does have what appears to be a securely sewed band on the back of it that you can loop a belt through. I can‚Äôt verify whether or not the stitches hold well but I can say they appear to be sewed in well enough.<br /><br />Now, onto the instrument itself! The holes are placed a good distance apart. I have long fingers and this ocarina fits them comfortably, but this doesn‚Äôt mean you need a large reach to find the holes. The sub holes are easy to reach and with the glossy finish your fingers can glide to them without much difficulty.<br /><br />I‚Äôll admit I was a bit apprehensive when I first looked at the ocarina on Amazon and saw that the strap hole actually went through the neck of the ocarina. Wouldn‚Äôt air go through it and mess with the notes? Turns out the answers no! The place the hole is drilled through has no access to the chamber the air you blow enters. This is a much prettier design then the little weird bumpy thing attached to the neck of my STL ocarina for its strap.<br /><br />The Ocarina sounds in tune to me, although I am no expert and have no way to check for sure. I did compare it to my STL (which they pride themselves as being completely in tune) and it matched it note for note without the breathiness the STL has on the higher pitches- which I will say is probably partially me for having amateur breath control but also once again raises this beautiful ocarina up again for its super easy breath control.<br /><br />And can I just mention how wonderful the customer service of this company is? They not only emailed me to make sure I‚Äôd received the ocarina alright but also sent another email later to make sure I loved the instrument. The answer is yes. I adore this little instrument.<br /><br />I am absolutely no expert on the ocarina or any instrument for that matter, just a sixteen year old who‚Äôd decided to try out the instrument I‚Äôd first discovered in my child hood video game. I‚Äôve only started playing a couple months ago- but that just goes to show this instrument is truly for everyone with a wish to play. Anyone can learn it. If your finding you want a little more instruction then the song book has to offer do yourself a favor and check out David Eric Ramos‚Äô you tube channel- he has a wonderful set of tutorials on how to play the ocarina and teaches you sheet music along the way. From what I can tell this is the perfect piece to start with, easy breath control, on pitch notes, holes placed perfectly, and twenty songs (seven of which are from Legend of Zelda if your purpose in ocarina searching has something to do with a certain fairy boy) in ocarina tabs to help you hit the ground running.<br /><br />If your just starting out and looking for a good ocarina to throw your first attempts at there‚Äôs no need to look any farther. You‚Äôve found it- and you don't even have to ask Navi.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712x4y0ID3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712x4y0ID3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712x4y0ID3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZzKkqesRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZzKkqesRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZzKkqesRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qNbby3GiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qNbby3GiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qNbby3GiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tSNBdmbQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tSNBdmbQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tSNBdmbQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00T0HVIY6,B00T0HVIY6,AGCOOL7ISQPXPWQIQQ7OCKACEWFA,1500688522720,13,True,2017-07-22 01:55:22.720

3.0,Yahama keyboard YPT-320,"I ordered this for my daughter who's taking music lesson.  I was very happy with the amount of time that the order was processed and shipped.  I placed the order on late Monday night and used Prime shipping for 2-day delivery and it arrived on Wednesday afternoon.  I received everything mentioned in the bundle: the keyboard, the stand, the headphone and the AC adapter.  Everything setup nicely but my only complaint is that the keyboard stand (World Tour brand) doesn't seem to be very study (a little wobbly) and it doesn't quite fit the Yamaha keyboard on the bottom very well.  The keyboard has these grooves on the bottom that you can screw onto the stand, but this stand isn't really made for that particular model.  Since I'm not an expert in keyboards like these, I assumed all stands were compatible with all keyboards when I purchased this.  When I did my research, I didn't see any reviews written on here regarding the stand that comes with this particular keyboard nor how the stand fits with this keyboard.  Had I known this in advance, I would have just bought the keyboard by itself without the extras and buy a stand that is made specifically for this keyboard.  Also, the description didn't say anything about what brand of the stand that comes with this bundle.  I assumed it was a Yamaha stand that goes with this keyboard.  There were little instruction on putting the stand together but I managed to put them together easily.  I couldn't really tell from the pictures of the instruction which end of the stand is the top and which is the bottom.  There are two long bars and two short bars when you put them together but I didn't know which was the legs and which was the ones to set the keyboard on.  Other than that, I'm happy with this order.  I haven't played much with the keyboard yet to review about this product.  But I will add more later when I get a chance to test out the sound.

5.0,"Awesome headphones, perfect balance","Before I bought these, I did a TON of research on headphones in the 100-500$ range.  These got consistently good reviews, but a bunch of people complained that they had to be broken in before they really shine and/or that the bass is weak and there are some blu-tack hacks out there to improve the bass.<br /><br />My opinion, these cans sound awesome. The bass is perfect out of the box. I dislike so many sound systems out there as they all seem designed to shake the room and all you hear is painfully throbbing bass. These cans seem to have the perfect balance across the tonal range.<br /><br />First off, my go to reference piece of music is Ariel Ramirez - Misa Criolla / Gloria.  A long time ago when I first started shopping in the high end audiophile shops, a salesperson used this piece to demonstrate the speaker/system quality. On a good system you can hear the singers swallow and little background noises that I just couldn't hear on the lower quality / not so perfect reproduction systems.  This piece of music played perfect through these cans, it was like listening to some of the higher quality b&w speakers.<br /><br />Throughout the day I went through a range of music from techno through the Eagles through some Piano Guys and Lindsay Stirling stuff )check youtube( and they all sounded awesome.<br /><br />I think if you're used to the brassy undertones to a lot of music/boom boxes these days then then tonal range of these will seem downplayed to you.<br /><br />If you like faithful reproduction of music with great depth and range, try these out.",[],B000065BPB,B07YM5ZHS9,AEBUSPQF6XERFJ73RMMDUTPUDWDA,1338526371000,3,True,2012-06-01 04:52:51.000

4.0,Good-quality bridge replacement,"If you are replacing a bridge for the first time, please look up videos on how to do it and take your time. Don't try to pry the old bridge off until all the glue has loosened up to the point where it wants to peel off easily. If you've never changed a bridge and you're working on an heirloom or otherwise valuable guitar, consider having a professional do it (it costs less than trashing your grandpa's 1960's CF Martin).<br /><br />I like playing on nylon strings, but my Ibanez Dreadnought doesn't like them. The string pegs always shoot off into low earth orbit as a result, which they don't do with steel strings for whatever reason, so I bought this bridge and installed it myself. I didn't care if I screwed up the guitar because it's a cheap guitar, but luckily, the replacing process went fine. I also installed an electric preamp and tuner into this guitar, and drilling a hole through the bridge for the under-saddle pickup went fine. The rosewood is decent quality and didn't crack or splinter.<br /><br />My only note for other Dreadnought owners is that the grooves in the nut are way too far apart for the neck, which is probably the result of making this one replacement set to work with a wide range of acoustic guitars. I just left my original nut in place. As for the saddle, you need to file it down to have the strings sit in it properly, and will have to (carefully) file them further to adjust the action.

4.0,Neat concept frustrated by early pricing and cost-effective alternatives,"With electronics, there is a counter-intuitive-yet-true statement that products trying too hard to be a &#34;ahead of the times&#34; will more quickly end up &#34;behind the times&#34;.  The DigiTech iStomp - which is undoubtedly a well-constructed, quality product - may well fall victim to that truth.<br /><br />The iStomp is digital effects pedal that simulates ONE effect pedal (distortion, chorus, compressor, reverb, etc.) at a time.  The effects are stored in the StompShop, which is an iOS (free) app, and then uploaded to the physical stompbox in a process that takes about 30 seconds.  Once uploaded, no connection is  required with the iOS device - the pedal will work the same on stage or in the middle of a cornfield (supposing you have the 9v power supply attached).<br /><br />The quality of the effects, in my opinion, is actually quite good.  Some of them suffer a little volume drop, but the overall results are excellent. I'm a recovering pedal addict, so a single unit that can switch from reverb to flanger in 30 seconds is a whole lot more appealing than having to BUY a reverb AND a flanger pedal, only to use the latter once in a blue moon.<br /><br />But from a meta perspective, the concept begins to fall apart.  Since the pedal can only be one thing at one time, it doesn't have practical versatility for anyone desiring effect changes in the middle of a set list, or even an intense jam session.  There are sticky labels you can place for some of the more popular effects, but otherwise, you have no idea what the four rotating knobs actually do, unless you have memorized it.<br /><br />The interface with my iPhone was fairly simple, but it often asked me to unplug or restart the device because the connection was lost.  Perhaps I did something wrong, but I feel like that process needs to be almost idiot-proof.  Also, I do not believe that my unit came with the new Lightning cable, so newer Apple devices will require some type of adapter.  If the company fails to support software updates, it could be difficult or inconvenient to switch effects in the near future.<br /><br />Then there's the issue of pricing.  I believe the early prices for this item were in excess of $150, perhaps even $200.  Since I bought it as a clearance item, I paid only a fraction of that, and am very pleased with the value.  But I can't give it a 5-star review in good conscience knowing that the vast majority of owners bought earlier and paid more.  While multi-effects processors have their own shortcomings, they offer considerably more flexibility that a stompbox that can only be one thing at one time.  Also, the StompShop downloads were only recently made free (with a few exceptions).  Prior to that, you had to pay extra for many of the effects, which was a further hidden cost.  Finally, there are iOS programs (such as JamUp XT and Agile AmpKit+) that offer full amp modeling, effects suites, and recording/DAW options for the same or less money as the iStomp.  It's easy to see how DigiTech may have talked themselves into the higher price point a few years ago, but the landscape has changed dramatically, and there are more low-cost effects options available today than ever before.<br /><br />All of that negativity aside, if you see one of these at a good price, absolutely give it a look.  The selection of effects is quite good.  Even if you set it up as only one effect pedal (such as reverb) that you didn't have, there's some potential value there.<br /><br />UPDATE #1 (Feb 2015) - Over a year later, the iStomp remains a useful &#34;swiss army knife&#34; if I want to fill in a sound that I don't have a particular pedal for.  This is particularly the case with the modulation (chorus, etc.) and reverb effects, of which there are several.  For example, if I want a good Spring Reverb pedal for an amp lacking reverb, spending $150+ for a Catalinbread Topanga (which is excellent) does not make a ton of sense, but I can load a 'verb onto my iStomp and it's actually really good.<br /><br />I would also note that subsequent to my review, I emailed DigiTech and requested all of the labels (8 pages I think), and they sent them to me for FREE within a few days.  The labels are adhesive but removable, so I was very pleased with that support, especially for a now-discontinued product.  (Don't know if this is still available).<br /><br />The iStomp continues to work with my iPad2, which is now on iOS 7, but I cannot say if it would work on newer devices using a 30-pin to Lightning adapter.  I suspect there will be compatibility issues in the future, so there may come a day where you cannot find your cable, and you're stuck with whatever pedal you last installed.<br /><br />UPDATE #2 (June 2016) - Still using and enjoying my iStomp, to the point where I kind of wish I had bought a 2nd one at the closeout prices!  My 4-star review remains because this was, in many respects, a poorly executed product, but the quality of what it offers is unquestioned.  Even if I only use it as a $40 Spring Reverb, it was an incredible value.",[],B00708NMWS,B00708NMWS,AG5ZVXXHEXDYUUODSEQC4XXV7DPA,1389116771000,9,False,2014-01-07 17:46:11.000

With the additional stability provided by the over-the-shoulder design, the left hand is freed up completely and can move effortlessly along the fingerboard.

The foam padding is pretty thin, and glued to the metal, which may result in some detachment depending on the environment.  Additionally, the shoulder rest is very adjustable due to the ability to bend the metal to fit your physique; however, over time the metal will bend and/or break.  Overall, this shoulder rest will probably not see more than 1 to 1 1/2 years of life before needing to be replaced for one or more reasons.<br /><br />Thank you!",[],B000BUHAXO,B000BUHAXO,AHTHJAFRNLKXBBR6FPNOBB2TSSAA,1523033084623,2,False,2018-04-06 16:44:44.623

5.0,Nearly flawless beginner instrument,"I've been playing this Uke everyday for about a week now, and it's absolutely wonderful. After the strings set in it stays in tune, it looks great (a couple very small flaws in the paint, but I only noticed because I was looking for them), and the two months of Take Lessons it comes with makes it a steal. I love the way it sounds, and as someone who has always struggled with string instruments, it was very easy to pick up. By day 3 I was already playing songs (granted, I'm a music major).<br />  If I have one real complaint it's that it comes with guitar picks instead of Ukelele picks (which are made of leather or felt as opposed to hard plastic).

3.0,...Master of none,"Pros: it lends itself to any place in a pedal board. Has something for everybody so it is always useful. above average quality of tone in at least one of every effect type. Best tuner  accuracy I've seen. Tap tempo for a number of effects. Tracking for the effects that utilize it is excellent. Some unique effects and classic tones. Midi capability (finally). Reasonably priced<br /><br />Cons: Un-intuitive interface (ex. The up button goes down in presets and the down button goes up in presets ). Re-naming presets is a little annoying. Knobs are not very precise (cheap feel to them). The footprint is quite bigger than an average pedal. The fidelity to the earlier individual modelers  that precede it is subpar<br /><br />Personal experience: I've had this for six-seven months now and I will say it's a keeper but it is not without its issues. I've had the privilege, thanks to the Lord, of owning quite a number of the pedals it models and I wouldn't chose most of its recreations over the real thing. Some are surprisingly good  (like the detune and harmony gave my Pitchfactor a run for its money...my money really) while some are just, like someone else stated...fillers. I've also own the M9 and sold it because I was not convince of the tone. stacking these effects doesn't even comes close to individualizing  each effect in its dedicated pedal. The overdrives were over all disappointing (put them up against their analog counterpart for yourself). I first got this to replace my FM4. While the tracking greatly improved I can only describe the difference in tone from watching a youtube video in 480p to 360p (I use to run the original FM4 through a bit-reduction pedal and the M5 takes less reduction to destroy the signal).

5.0,Gaming/Skype,"A year or so ago, I was playing Left4Dead for the PC.  One of the voices from a player on my team was coming through particularly clearly, so I asked him what mic he had.  At first he thought I was making fun of him, but he eventually told me that he was using a Blue Snowball.  I hadn't had a working mic at the time because the several I've had over the years had all broken within six months of normal use.  So I looked around at reviews and saw this new one was THX certified and had all these added features, etc.  I thought, ""hmmm, my speakers are THX certified and those are awesome, so..."" and it looked like it was built better than the Snowball.<br /><br />Fast forward to now.  The only complaints I have are minor and have nothing to do with the sound quality.<br /><br />1. The volume knob on the front is a little flimsy, but I don't ever touch it anymore.<br />2. The red light on the I/O button should turn off when it's off instead of blinking.  Seriously, who thought that one up?<br />3. The mini-USB connection at the base of the mic should have some kind of support bezel to make it more sturdy.  Since the cable is pulling back off the desk, it's putting a very small amount of strain on the connector.  There should be a support that can be fitted around the mini-USB cable and screws into the base of the mic around the connection - something that immobilizes the cable completely.  And the connection should be made at an angle.  Or use a mini-USB L-cable if the connection were to be on the back.  Do those exist?<br /><br />Other than those minor details, it's great.  I never have to wear a headset again... which, let's be honest, looked dumb. This mic doesn't pick up background noise like gunfire or music coming from my speakers - unless I turn them past a my normal volume.

5.0,GREAT for recording live concerts.,"This is a good camera for recording live concerts.  It has a few minor issues that annoy me, but for the most part, it's excellent.<br /><br />Issue 1: Battery life.  Recording is NOT POWERED BY THE USB ADAPTER!  I recently recorded a 10 hour, multiple band, live concert on this camera.  at 720p/AAC 320 MOV, the camera crashed about every 2.5 hours. The camera was attached to mains power with a Zoom AD-17 AC Adapter to the onboard USB port, but still... battery only!  Thankfully, I brought a pile of previously charged BT-03 batteries, so the problems were minimal.  PLAN AHEAD.  ---<br /><br />UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE!  I debugged this and it turns out that my problem was using too long of a USB cable from the power adapter to the camera.. When using a short USB cable and a electrical extension to the power adapter instead; I can power the camera fine for hours and hours.<br /><br />Issue 2: digital 'zoom' capability.  Even at 1.5x maximum digital zoom, I was barely able to zoom in on the stage from the soundboard, about 200 feet away.  So, the video quality of the bands playing... not so great.  This camera really would benefit from being a LOT closer to the stage, since it has such a wide angle lens, but then you have issues with the sound field and where you're going to convince the sound techs to let you plug in.<br /><br />Issue 3: Turn the -20dB PAD *on*.  This comes set off by default, and you will experience 'digi-fart' distortion at an indicated -12dB signal level on the external XLR preamp inputs.  With the pad set, the signal level indicators are correct.<br /><br />Issue 4: The level controls are digital encoder wheels, not potentiometers, so it's sometimes difficult to get good signal balance on the XLR inputs.  The controls are very sensitive, and each &#34;tick&#34; is about 3dB of gain.<br /><br />The good stuff:  The included camera's X/Y mic and foam wind shield were flawless.  No wind noise on a somewhat breezy day.  Also, I recorded ambient from the mic's and L/R house mix from the board, without bothering to split it into separate audio channels, and the audio is excellent.  Getting the mix right on the camera makes everything simple.",[],B00S9W1XVQ,B00S9W1XVQ,AF6FJHCMCLYR67GEFS2VH6TMS4XQ,1436192743000,57,True,2015-07-06 14:25:43.000

5.0,Great guitar for beginners and intermediate players,"owned for a couple months at the time of review and I can say that for the price this guitar is hard to beat for the features it comes with. The strings were average, nothing extraordinary but quite usable. What sold me on this guitar specifically was having 24 frets and a whammy bar at this price point let alone from ibanez.<br /><br />You certainly get what you pay for as I noticed some imperfections in the white finish that couldnt be removed. Doing bends on this guitar I noticed that it definitely felt gritty and the tuning stability is not the greatest but will hold as long as you dont mess with it. I also noticed out of the box that the trem system had to be adjusted because the springs were pulling too hard, making bending up barely possible. The action had to be significantly lowered out of the box but at this point im just nit-picking and there was the obligatory fret buzz.<br /><br />This is a great guitar for beginners and intermediate players as it offers features when paired together are hard to find at this price point.",[],B01M27ODSL,B07T52KYGQ,AHAMK2JWUS5TR7JFVRP5HYYZ67TQ,1675106718046,0,True,2023-01-30 19:25:18.046

3.0,NOT VERY GOOD!,I have the Pubb bass and a Stratocaster in this color blue so figured when I saw the Monoprice Tele in the same color I might as well have the set. The bass and the Stratocaster came in beautiful condition with very little to be done. This Tele however was not like the other two. It came with scratches and looked as if it may have been a demo. I eventually got most of the scratches out with Eterna Shine. The neck on this one was unplayable. At least 5 bad frets and sharp fret edges necessitating a fret level and end fret dressing. If you‚Äôre thinking of modding this guitar putting in new pickups is not a problem. Putting standard size CTS or other American sized pots is. The control cavity is just a bit too small so I was forced to go to Bournes mini pots. I had one tuner that just slipped terribly so I replaced the tuners with locking tuners which were a direct fit. I am not sure what kind of wood this is made from but this Tele is heavy. 11+ lbs. for a Tele? It is heavier than the Pubb bass or the Stratocaster by far so if you have a poor back this isn‚Äôt for you. The neck is wider than my LyxPro and the maple fretboard is bare. I had to treat it quite a bit before it stopped making that string drag noise and getting the strings to slide across the fretboard smoothly. Neither of the other two Monoprice guitars did that. It looks like a total case of a Monday build. On top of the inflated price gouging price I paid over the price on the Monoprice site (because they were out) all the problems and the abominable shipping I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this guitar to anyone. Also you don't know what you're going to get with this Tele. The pictures show two different bridges. One a six saddle adjustable with string through and one with the old style can never intonate two strings to a saddle bridge. I think they show two different pictures just to sow you may get either or. Mine did not have the six saddle or string through. Monoprice let me down on this one.,[],B07921LDYQ,B0BNCDVD4M,AEMSFZ4NLED647BP3ZCQEY3FNGKA,1662493038154,0,True,2022-09-06 19:37:18.154

5.0,Excellent value for money,"I bought this for online meetings and to see how it would compare to my $300 Sennheiser XSW-D.  For a fraction of the price this mic acquits itself remarkably well.  To be fair the Sennheiser is a $120 lavalier mic combined with a $200 radio mic transmitter receiver pair but, even so, the Sennheiser is 6 times the price of this product.  And it's not 6 times better.<br /><br />If you are looking to sound good on Zoom calls, your podcast of YouTube videos this is an excellent starting point.  It works with cellphones, computers and mic pre-amps equally well (turn on the power switch for inputs that don't provide low voltage phantom power) so it's very versatile.  The cable is long (almost too long, actually) so you can be a good distance from the recorder and I've not noticed any noise or hum.<br /><br />When compared to the Sennheiser it is a little bass heavy and the high frequencies (sybillants etc.) are a little muted and ""splashy"".  Being omnidirectional it does capture a little more ambient noise than the Sennheiser but, again, the performance is entirely acceptable for most applications.

4.0,Good Capo.,"I have a collection of acoustic guitars, and occasionally enjoy throwing the capo on while playing around with riffs.  Because my voice is in a lower register than many other females, I tend to tune about a half step low on at least one or two of my acoustics.  Now and then I will have the radio on and will just teach myself songs as they come on (this is a fun activity for my kids as they watch in amazement and awe, or try to challenge me), so the capo is good to have on hand for those instances (no need to keep tuning to the various tunings from different tunes).<br /><br />I've noticed a few comments about the spring giving way after repeated use; I have not experienced this issue.  The capo has worked well for several of my guitars (though it is a tight fit on my nylon and tends to be more efficient with the smaller fret sizes).  If you have a Jumbo or a wide fret board, I may advise you pick up something a little more solid and/or wide).  This works sufficiently for me though, and I've had no issues whatsoever.

5.0,"Excellent performance, appearance, and value.","I was quite surprised to find a large and heavy box was waiting for me when I returned home from work today.  A closer look revealed that the box contained my Taylor K4 equalizer.  I had only ordered it a few days before, and here it was on my doorstep.<br /><br />I opened the box and was surprised to find that the Taylor balanced straight TRS to right angle TRS cable was included (typically a $50 value).  A power supply and a DVD explaining the use of this parametric equalizer were also included.<br /><br />My first reaction to the appearance and ""heft"" of the unit was ""WOW.""  This is a beautifully made item, with real wood, and real metal, and a huge number of control parameters, inputs and output capabilities.<br /><br />I plugged in my Taylor ES guitar, and did some experimenting.  The tone shaping possibilities appear to be endless.  Very clean, very clear, with range from the nearly transparent to the desperately dramatic.  This is the most versatile tone shaping pre-amp I've seen for a guitar system.<br /><br />As an engineer, I have run across parametric equalizers before, so the basic concepts weren't new to me.  A person who is unfamiliar with parametric equalizers will want to spend some time watching the included DVD in order to make some sense out of the controls.  Its a bit more complex than twiddling with a three band equalizer.  High end and low end controls are ""normal,"" but the midrange allows you to adjust the center frequency for the control, as well as the amount of boost or cut, and the quality factor (which essentially adjusts the bandwidth of the effect).<br /><br />I am very pleased with this product.

I'm weirdly excited to carry this to my next recording session in a few days.<br /><br />The hardware on the bag feels really sturdy, especially the clip for the shoulder strap. The bag keeps its shape when I carry it full of the above gear. And the padding on the bottom makes me feel confident about moving all this stuff around (still carefully, of course).<br /><br />I also really love the blue color on the inside. A black interior would make it so hard to see all my cables, which are also black. The pop of color makes grabbing things at a glance really easy.<br /><br />I'm only sorry I didn't buy this bag last year. I've been carrying around a regular duffel bag, with most of my gear still in its boxes. Huge and unruly, and not any safer than this bag. I found the other reviews so helpful in my decision to buy.

This happened to be the first one we looked at and probably was a good part of the reason she decided she wanted one.

5.0,The beginning of a career,"I have a family member who graduated from film school and wants to film her own documentary now. I got this for her to help get her started. I saw that it said it had a boom and that sounded like something she will need. I opened it upon arrival to make sure it looks like it will work for her. I think it will.<br />The microphone itself is large. It's not a flimsy little thing.<br /><br />The clamp for the table or desk has a nice range of sizes it will fit on, with the 2-inch opening.<br />The price seems fair for this.<br />I don't want to plug it in to my computer in case it starts to register the product, so I'm not sure of the sound quality.  So I didn't rate that portion yet. I'll see what she thinks once she opens her gift and starts to use it.<br />The box is nice because the foam sections fit the parts very specifically so I think it makes sense to keep it in this box between uses. It should keep it from getting damaged as the foam is thicker and firmer than most. The box isn't huge so it will make it easy to transport between filming locations.<br /><br />The instructions were nice, as they had actual pictures, not just drawings/illustrations of things.<br /><br />So far I'm giving it 5 stars.

4.0,Tips for use and installation:,"I am returning to the cello after a long absence. I bought a brand-new different-sized cello and I was just too lazy and impatient to learn the proper fingering totally by ear. I see a few misunderstandings in the reviews. First, the markings will not be exact. Every instrument is different, for one thing. Also, the A string fingerings are always going to be a bit higher on the neck than the guideline and the G string fingerings will be a bit lower. So a straight line could never be exact. A marking is just a general guide. I learned originally without any marks at all. You will quickly learn to find the sweet spots on your own strings. Additionally, the guide should not be sturdy, have strong adhesive, or be expected to last long. This is a very temporary aid. You will not need it long at all. So light adhesive is actually a good thing, since you will be taking it off soon.<br />About installation: The guide is perforated in three places. You can take it apart to make application easier. You can also loosen your strings, although as a beginner you might hesitate to do so. As I mentioned before, I am lazy, so I left the strings alone and loosened the top third of the backing, then folded it down flat behind the rest of the sticker. Then I carefully slid the whole sticker beneath the strings down near the bottom of the finger board where things are more roomy and gently slid it along the bottom of the strings until it was in the right spot. Then I laid it down onto the fingerboard and smoothed it with my finger along the space between the strings, working my way out from the center. I rolled the backing down another third, repeated the smoothing process, then did it again for the bottom third. Finally, I smoothed the wings down on the edges of the fingerboard. My sticker is smooth and unwrinkled, without bubbles. However, I purposely did not try to get a really good, tight seal. I don't want goo left behind when I remove the sticker next week. If you get lots of wrinkles, bubbles, rips, etc, don't worry. It won't interfere with your practice, and the sticker won't be on there long enough to matter, anyway. Even if you wanted the guide to last (you won't) it couldn't. Your fingerboard is made of ebony for a reason. Just playing normally will wear a rosewood or other inferior fingerboard down in no time, so a sticker doesn't stand a chance. If, somehow, goo does remain after the sticker is removed, use a cello cleaner to remove it. Don't try any home remedies! Fingerboards are expensive to repair!<br />One final word: Stick with it until you get the hang of your instrument. If you love music, your cello will bring you joy and help you unwind for the rest of your life.",[],B07B9W2DV6,B07B9VR8KS,AEDSQQFZHQ4BEEH75GSGSSG6S2CA,1615921722860,3,True,2021-03-16 19:08:42.860

3.0,"Not The best but it does work, SOMEWHAT!!!","Oh, before you order this pickup, make sure the wood is no thicker than 1 and 1/4 inch where the plug jack is to be installed..<br /><br />Okay, here is the scoop on this item...  I got it pretty quick, about 12 days total..  No installation  instructions so be prepared to look on the web for help with this...  You will need a 1/2 inch and a 9/64th drill bit, 1/2 for the jack and the 9/64th for the piezo hole.  You will also have to do some cutting ( or routing ) in the saddle for the bridge or cut the bridge down.<br /><br /> I didn't have a router small enough so I cut the bridge down.  I had to take off 3.5 mm.  I made my mark on the bridge and put it into a 3&#34; vise, letting it stick up 3.5 mm and used a file to remove what I needed.. Drill the 9/64th hole at one end or the other so the piezo is in the middle of the saddle.<br /><br />Remove your existing strap pin and place a piece of masking tape over the screw hole..  This will help keep the wood from chipping while drilling.  Drill a 1/2 inch hole using the strap pin screw hole as center..  Measure the thickness of the wood where you drilled the hole and adjust the jack inside tightening nut.  I used a small ended 1/4 cable to run through the hole to the sound hole and plugged into the jack and pulled it through the hole..Install the tightening  nut and strap nut....  Install the batteries with the &#34;+&#34; up on both batteries...  Complete the installation and your set...<br />.<br />Start with the volumes down and just mess around with it.<br /><br />I seem to be getting a little distortion at higher volumes.

And I say&#34; I expect it to do what they claim&#34;....  If they would fix it to do what they say it will do, I would gladly pay $50.00 for it....<br /><br />Look, with the work you need to do to install this and if you were not able to install this yourself, it would cost you around $100.00  to have a guitar tech do it..

With this HSS strat I find I‚Äôm playing the bridge more than anything else. You can do coil tapping but I find it‚Äôs not exactly the same as a traditional single coil strat, and that‚Äôs fine.

3.0,"It's all right for PC-based setups, but...","I've had this a couple of years now.  It has spent most of its time back in its box because it mostly does not suit my needs. I own a lot of Korg gear, and this is the only Korg thing I've bought that I wish I hadn't.  But first...<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br />1. It's solid. You can smack the heck out the pads and not worry about it breaking.<br /><br />2. It's ultra lightweight and will fit into a large handbag, backpack, laptop case, nor will take it up very much space on your desk.<br /><br />3. You can hit anywhere on the pad, such as the barest smidge of a corner and the pad will work.<br /><br />4. If you own a Korg Kronos, and I do not, you can connect the NanoPad directly to the Kronos via the USB port and the NanoPad will work without a PC or Mac in between.<br /><br />5. The pads can be configured on a per-pad basis, meaning some pads can send out note/velocity data, other pads can send out CCs (see also the cons below), and some more pads can send MIDI program changes, along with each having the ability to be a momentary switch or a toggle switch, all within one scene. In addition, each pad can send up to four notes, CCs or program changes at once. All of that is pretty decent and worth the price of admission. You can also enable or disable the Gate Arp/Touch Scale options if those features appeal to you.  The X-Y pad, too, is configurable with the software, and you can choose between pitch bend or MIDI CC transmission on either axis. You can set both to CC if you want. There's not much point to sending both to pitch bend unless your pad swiping skills are messy, because the pitch bend on both axes is not additive, and you can only pitch bend one whole note anyway.<br /><br />And that's about it for the pros.<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />1. The velocity sensitivity of the pads is spotty at best.  There are only three velocity curves available plus one constant velocity value option in the Korg Kontrol software. To get the most sensitivity out of the pads, you'll want to choose the ""Hard"" curve option.  If that doesn't seem much different to you than the other two curves, you're not alone.  With the absolute lightest touch I can manage, the pads typically send out velocity values between 5 and 45 on the hard curve. That isn't particularly expressive and you will struggle to play with any kind of nuance.<br /><br />2. You'll need a computer and some kind of DAW or other MIDI software like MIDI-OX for this to work (unless you have a Kronos -- I don't know if the new Korg Nautilus will work with it straightaway). This is the most annoying thing for me.  If you don't work ITB (in the box, i.e. on a computer), then you'll need to get a USB MIDI Host, and those cost between $50 to several hundred dollars.  I do not recommend buying a NanoPad if you plan to work DAW-less, because why spend more money on a USB Host just to get your NanoPad to work with your gear? If you already have lots of class compliant controllers and a USB MIDI host, then getting this might be OK for you.  If Korg ever updates the design of the Nanopad, I hope they consider adding some 3.5mm MIDI jacks like what you get on a BeatStep Pro.<br /><br />3. The X-Y pad. While the Korg Kontrol software lets you configure the pads on a per-pad level differently in its four different scenes, the X-Y pad can only be configured on a global level, which carries over from scene to scene. That limits its functionality greatly.  When the X-Y pad is configured to send out CCs on either axis, the pad becomes unipolar on that axis. It would be better if it let you specify unipolar or bipolar behavior for CCs, along with giving you two CCs per axis (to work like a Korg joystick controller). There is also no option for each axis to send on a different MIDI channel, the pad can only send on one channel. There is a Touch/Release mode that activates when you simply touch the pad, but I don't find that particularly useful for me. It might work for you.  Finally you can't set the amount of pitch bend the pad will do (unless I have missed that option somewhere).<br /><br />4. There is no aftertouch (AT) on the pads. For the price of this, that's fair enough, but it would be nice. If channel or polyphonic AT is important to you, get another pad controller that does it.<br /><br />5. When the pads are set to transmit CC data, they can only send out a full data value of 127. You cannot configure this to send out a certain value to be used as a threshold value for instance, or to respond to velocity as input. That's a shame, in my opinion. This severely limits the usability of CCs on the pads. But you can set a threshold value on the X-Y pad when in Touch/Release mode. You can forget sending out any kind of NRPN to your gear too.<br /><br />6. It's lightweight but the rubber feet don't hold the NanoPad in place very well on some surfaces, like aluminum on a keyboard panel for instance. I use a piece of non-slip shelf liner to keep the NanoPad from moving when I use it.<br /><br />Summary: If you're looking for a decent, basic pad controller to beat on indiscriminately, and you don't mind working via your computer, then this might fit the bill for you.  If you're looking for nuanced play, a full MIDI spec implementation and tons of configuration options for controlling your extensive MIDI gear, then you'd be better off spending a bit more money on a pad controller or sequencer with pads.  After trying to get on with this thing for a few months, I ended up getting a BeatStep Pro instead for the finer pad work, but I do use the X-Y pad on the NanoPad for pitch bending one of my synths.",[],B004M8YPKM,B00X7DD6GW,AGHZXGFGQMGQDXBKN4YFR7BOQAAA,1621572843063,16,True,2021-05-21 04:54:03.063

4.0,Great mic if you are on a budget,"Obviously, the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" has a certain degree of truth to it. So don't expect this microphone to produce professional results. However, considering its cost it does perform admirably. I have owned this mic for over two years and have used it to great extent. Mostly to record dialogue for short films, but also to get foley sounds and also field recordings for background sound. It is generally a good mic with a few flaws.<br /><br />There is a degree of hiss going on, especially on 'tele' mode. However if you get close enough to your subject (a cheap boom pole with shockmount can be purchased for around 60-70 dollars US) it will produce clear, high fidelity audio. Not perfect, I usually do some light noise reduction and equalization in post production, but it's pretty solid audio. I've used other shotgun mics that produce 'tinnier' sound, and lack that full, robust sound that comes with an improved frequency response. Also, the mic is mono, which means it'll only record left-channel audio. There are two easy ways to fix this. Either purchase a mono-to-stereo 3.5mm adapter (will set you back around 5-10 dollars USD, and should be found at a local Radio Shack or similar store), or simply double the audio in post production. Also, the mic itself isn't shielded from vibration, and neither is the shoe mount that is included. I found that attaching it directly to my camera doesn't work, as motor noise from the camera's tape mechanism and zoom drive translate through the body of the camera into the mic. However, your results my vary.<br /><br />'Tele' mode is something I have only experimented with briefly. As I said, due to the loud hiss it produces, I stopped using it instead opting for the less directional, but cleaner sound 'normal' mode produces. However, the 'tele' mode could be useful in a pinch, to zoom in on a subject when you can't physically get close enough. It does seem to do a good job of 'zeroing in' on sound. Another thing I like about the mic is the fact that it takes a single AA battery. Many similar mics (even more expensive brands such as Sennheisser) use button-cell batteries, which are slightly harder to come by and more expensive. The ATR-55 uses a single AA, and a cheap 'Heavy Duty' battery should last you dozens of hours of usage.<br /><br />Whether or not to buy this mic all comes down to budget and usage. I'm a hobbyist, I shoot short films and other things for fun and have never made a cent doing so, so I can't spend 300 dollars or more on a microphone. If I had the income to support spending thousands of dollars on gear instead of hundreds, I would certainly upgrade to a better mic. But for now, it does its job.

5.0,SY-30: Great piece of kit - if you have the right mindset,"4.5/5<br /><br />This thing is DEEP. And I don't mean deep with buried menus or plethoras of features and FX. I mean the SY-300, like all analog synthesizers, requires a certain curious, patient, sound design mindset to appreciate and to get full use out of. And I suspect the reason why players vehemently HATE/LOVE this box, is due to a.) whether or not you actually enjoy and emulate the styles of music that make use of analog synths (DnB, Dub, EDM, electronica, industrial) and b.) you have the patience and curiosity I mentioned above to design your own patches to achieve the sounds in your head or that you like on your favorite records. It's like learning a new language - it's not easy or quick, but it is rewarding when you dial in a sound that makes your bass or guitar sound like something you can't replicate with digital instruments. The output flexibility is overlooked in this unit as well. Via USB, you can split effected, effected or other combos into your DAW software for some really cool recording capabilities. On the right pedalboard, this thing will be a weapon. Build quality is fantastic, menus are ergonomic, connectors are solid.<br /><br />My critiques: The manual is horrid. And because the unit is so new and niche, there's not a lot of info out there on how to do things like &#34;resynth&#34; from a DAW.<br /><br />And yes, the presets are wholly unusable for just about any genre of music. In fact, I think Boss could have saved time and storage space by foregoing presets altogether; rather they should have provided a &#34;synth cookbook&#34; that encourages players to recreate and tweak sounds that achieve specific iconic results. The presets are so whacked out, they actually distract instead of accelerate. It also doesn't help that they hire session, fusion guitar players to demo this thing which I think gives the wrong impression of it's strengths to potential buyers. I'd like to see them give this thing to Nerve, F.U.K.T., Papadosio or The Algorithm to see what kind of actual music they can make with it.<br /><br />Finally, tone central software is fine and all, but having curated, &#34;endorser&#34; patch sharing is only cool if you actually like the music these guys do. Again, ditch the idea this is for virtuoso shred-dudes and hire some guys actively making great electronic synth music, with readily available $500 guitars and amps.

4.0,Great for beginners,"I've been moving between temporary apartments for a while now while I save up for a house, but I couldn't wait for that to stop to start learning the keyboard like I'd always wanted to. Absent a teacher and the funds for a full 88-key keyboard or a standard piano, I eventually settled on this with some research and the help of some piano playing friends.<br /><br />The keyboard itself is great. It comes with an instruction manual detailing it's functions (you'll definately want to read this) and a sample DVD showing off some of Yamaha's video ""get to know your keyboard"" products. While informative, I didn't find these DVD episodes to be very helpful for learning to play the keyboard so I haven't watched them since. The keyboard sounds crisp and clear and works well with headphones. The keys all work nicely and the samples of other instruments sound good as well. The included ""learn to play"" songs are helpful enough in that the LED screen displays what key is making each note, but it's pretty quick and will take some time to get used to.<br /><br />So the keyboard is solid, but what about the accessories in this bundle? While my keyboard arrived nice and in one piece, my headphones were already in several pieces. One earphone was entirely broken, but luckily the 3.5mm adapter is still there and that works like a charm. The one speaker that does work for me is fine though, so I suppose that's something.<br /><br />The stand seems like it wasn't made for the YPT-320, the model I got it with. There are grooves on the bottom of the keyboard to help the stand hold it in place, but this stand is ever so slightly off point with them. It still holds the keyboard well enough though and as long as I don't lift the keyboard or try to move it off the stand, it doesn't move.<br /><br />The power adapter is fine.

It took a lot of research to find out how exactly you tackle latency issues in StudioOne, but when I finally learned how to set &#34;optimal&#34; settings, I only managed to reduce the latency time down to ~45ms. It was okay, but just delayed enough that your playing doesn't feel right. Upon even more research, I learned that this device runs on USB 1.0. That's a SLOW data transfer, which means that even with a good sound card in your computer (I don't have one), it might not be possible to fix latency.

5.0,Beautiful Violin--Excellent Customer Service,"This is a beautiful violin and comes with everything you need to begin playing immediately.  For the last year, I have had the desire to begin learning the violin.  I had never even touched a violin, until I ordered and received my new violin from Kennedy.  I first heard of Kennedy after perusing the Amazon website and was impressed with the number of positive reviews.  On Amazon, I looked at both ‚ÄúKennedy Bunnel Basic Clearance Violin‚Äù and the ‚ÄúBunnel G2 Violin Outfit‚Äù.  I didn‚Äôt know what the differences were, so I contacted Kennedy and asked.  Here is their response:  &#34;The two instruments in question are both part of our student line of violins. The Bunnel Basic is actually a Bunnel G2 that has cosmetic flaws. Since we sell most of our instruments online we try to give our customers as much information as possible about the appearance of the instruments prior to purchase. If a G2 violin has any flaws in the appearance we downgrade it to the Bunnel Basic so that the customers are aware of the situation. Our Bunnel Pupil is of a similar style, but not quite the quality level of the Bunnel G2. If you are looking for a violin that has a great sound and don't mind some cosmetic issues, the Bunnel Basic is a fantastic deal.‚Äù  I took their advice and bought the Bunnel Basic Clearance Violin.  I couldn‚Äôt be happier!  I looked at the Kennedy website for general information (lots of good info!), YouTube videos to begin learning the basics of playing, and I just had my second violin lesson with my violin teacher last night.

Maybe I'm just thinking of my old school Meredian, MS USA stuff! Didn't hesitate to buy Peavey but will be more cautious next time. Sad how many good names (for example Kenmore) sure don't mean what they used to. How does the saying go?, ""past success does not guarantee future results.""<br /><br />Tried it out for a couple weeks with a Roland RD300 and promptly returned it. Keyboard volume all but maxed (7/8ths) running mono out to the KB3. No way should something this large and heavy have so little volume. 60 watts thru 12"" should make some noise in imo. The tone was very nice for keys but not that great (kinda bassy) for voice... but the real problem is that for it to be even close to anything you might consider ""almost loud"" the channel and main volumes had to be nearly maxed; and at that point the noise floor has been raised to the point of an ugly hiss. The weakest 60 watts I've ever worked with.<br /><br />The KB3 has 5 star looks and features.

5.0,"A great, simple upgrade","Have an inexpensive thin-body guitar with a shallow sound. Once I installed the bone nut and saddle, wow! What a difference. The dimensions fit the generic guitar well without much adjustment. Well worth the money. Makes me wonder why manufacturers don't just put in bone nuts and saddles instead of the cheap plastic ones. A huge difference, makes the cheap guitar sound like a much more expensive one. One comment: why are people so obsessed with low-action on their guitars?! That makes it prone to dreaded fret buzz. Since I use silk and steel strings, E-flat tuning, and fingerpick and strumming with a full range of force, allowing the strings lots of space to vibrate and project forcefully is quite satisfying as a player.

5.0,"If you want a modeling amp, this one will not dissapoint...","First, this is not anything more or less than what Line 6 advertises it to be. It is a modeling amp and it does it's job well. It can fill in as a gig amp if you need it to, it will also serve well in a studio if you intend on using custom sounds. I can tell you it certainly has a few quirks, and with a 33 page user manual available online via the LIne 6 site, you should spend some time learning how it works before you haul it out to a stage somewhere. The amp has been a boat load of fun for me and for my 6 year old son who has shown some interest in playing guitar. He mostly likes to play with the different presets and find something funky to annoy his mother with (Ha!!!). Whatever the intended use, I would suggest a person read plenty of reviews and potentially test drive one at a music store before making a purchase. It would definitely help if an individual is not familiar with modeling amps. All in all I am thrilled with the purchase. Not everyone appreciates every piece of hardware available. People who bust on Line 6 stuff should not buy Line 6. Personally, it was exactly what I was looking for, however no piece of hardware can be all things to all people.

4.0,Great Instrument.,"Before I purchased this flute, my experience with a flute was limited to the recorder/flauta dolce and what little I learned on the concert flute in my university woodwind methods class. However, the difficult part was getting used to the width of the holes. For the most part, I can play it rather well. My biggest complaint overall is the key itself. Since I primarily play the clarinet and saxophone, it may just be that I'm not used to the flute, but for some reason, I cannot make the low D respond. The low E and F# do not respond well unless I press the key. I can get the D# out but I believe that the foot joint either requires another hole or needs to be short for the notes to respond better.<br />Overall, it is a great instrument at a good price. For a musician, whether or not a flutist, or even for a varying instrumentalist, this is well worth a buy to own as a fun instrument. If you can get the low D or even live without it, then I recommend this instrument.<br />Update: Soon after receiving, I ordered a Rosewood Irish Flute without the key. It's slightly longer but with the vents holes on the foot joint, I've realized that the notes respond perfectly. Therefore, it's my belief that the one with a key should be made with a vent hole. Again, it's still a great instrument for it's price. Honestly, I recommend both flutes.<br />EDIT: I recently finished up a semester of flute lessons. While this flute is easier to play now, the low D is still a problem. I think it just needs a vent hole and the other notes respond better with the key pressed open (serving as a vent hole). Again, other than that, I like it.",[],B00103A3CQ,B00103A3CQ,AEAT4HG66ZJFY6QIW3H54HFOMU5Q,1266913601000,1,True,2010-02-23 08:26:41.000

Outside in direct sun not so much, but looks pretty good in the shade. And brilliant at night!<br /><br />This fantastic lightsaber allows you to have all the qualities and extras of a $300+ blade without the $300+ price.<br />I definitely recommend it to everyone!<br /><br />TL;DR: Excellent sturdy lightsaber. Customizable color and sound. Decent battery life. Good brightness. Clear instructions. Easy to use. Love it dearly. Would buy again.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vNfy-o1JL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vNfy-o1JL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vNfy-o1JL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07TB9KVY8,B09PG5H8PK,AF3OQ3KNPRDF6JLRRH6OTHFNRTFA,1570992857065,30,True,2019-10-13 18:54:17.065

(The only modification I made was to remove the back cover,  loosely stuff a couple of plastic bags (such as you'd get when buying things at Walgreen's or Target) in there,  and then replace the back cover,  which served to nicely tone down the otherwise loud voice of the instrument.

5.0,Take the first train to Clarksville.....bring your Gretsch!,"The Gretsch G5420T hollow body guitar is an exceptional instrument for jazz, blues, rock-a-billy and funk.  The Body is balanced and light weight. It has 22 medium jumbos frets and cloud inlays.  This model has a licensed Bigsby trem and great sounding pickups. The PRO series of this guitar has the TV-Jones pickups but the character of the Gretsch  Blacktop‚Ñ¢ Filter'Tron‚Ñ¢ pickups in this guitar is a real deal maker.  The body is actually hollow with no large block inside however it does has a post between the top and back.  It also has a pinned bridge. You will have to purchase a case for the guitar since Gretsch does not throw that into the deal.  Personally, I don't use gig bags. Gretsch guitars have been around for a long time. This guitar was built in the Korean facility.  They have done an excellent job.  The finish is flawless and the Gloss Urethane is applied perfectly. The body is a 5 ply arched maple.  i really enjoy playing this instrument. It sounds different from my other guitars and I find that to be refreshing.  check out my unboxing video on YOUTUBE.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br /> [[ASIN:B008GWLDVO Gretsch G5420T Electromatic Single Cutaway Hollow Body Guitar - Aspen Green]]","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716MRh1fK3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716MRh1fK3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716MRh1fK3L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716hT1TxVGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716hT1TxVGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716hT1TxVGL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717xLwWs-rL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717xLwWs-rL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717xLwWs-rL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718h1Vw3N9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718h1Vw3N9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718h1Vw3N9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AV64AyqxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AV64AyqxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AV64AyqxL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FJnNjtsvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FJnNjtsvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FJnNjtsvL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bPAUtYxKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bPAUtYxKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bPAUtYxKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dS8Y1QK-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dS8Y1QK-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dS8Y1QK-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gzkeYRLBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gzkeYRLBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gzkeYRLBL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71it---tjOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71it---tjOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71it---tjOL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00D581GAM,B00D581GAM,AG3OOISK5XLYFVRZWJZX6GXFSODQ,1462322376000,3,False,2016-05-04 00:39:36.000

5.0,Totally Awesome accessory for your Blink500 Pro kit!,"I love this hand held microphone holder!  I was so impressed when I took it out of the packaging and saw that there was a wind guard!  Once you attach your Blink500 mic to it, the microphone holder actually charges your mic, but it becomes one with your mic so it needs to be paired with the transmitter (which is a one button operation.)<br />  It takes a couple of hours to charge the stick, it has an 1,100 mAh battery in the microphone holder, and it conveniently has a power indicator light on it.  The holder is charged with a USB C cable that's included, it's roughly 8"" tall and weighs 68 grams.  The build on this is very strong, and this is a must-have if you have the Blink500 Pro kit.

4.0,"Nice looking, but flawed instrument","I had trouble finding much information about these guitars when deciding to purchase, so want to share some of my experience.<br /><br /> I bought this expecting that would be a project to be adequately playable, and that was indeed the case. Came set-up ok, but the neck had a lot high spots that needed to be leveled. The tune-o-matic bridge buzzed a lot and needed to be replaced along with the stock strings, which were dull sounding out of the box. Under the hood, the drill holes are really bad - wood chips and lots of sawdust left in the control cavity needed to be cleaned out and the pots were really scratchy from all the dust and junk in there. Last issue, was the finish came with a bunch of cracks along the binding, which is probably from squeezeout and not finishing the binding properly before applying the finish.<br /><br />For me, these were fixable problems, and it is now a pretty nice playing instrument, but if you are not looking for a project, don't have a few hours to clean-up the poor build work, or want something that will be ready out of the box, there are better options. Quality control of these seems pretty hit or miss and you may end up with a nice looking, but flawed instrument.  Still, since I wanted a project and put time in to do set-up and adjustments this is fun to play - I like the control set-up, the trem is fun, and it has a nice feel. Surprised by the pick ups too - was going to flip them to p90s, but ended up keeping them in for not. They get some pretty doomy/heavy growl when you throw some gain on them.<br /><br />All told, as a project guitar, have been satisfied with it, but it did take some work to get there.",[],B0828QRC2B,B0C33796HK,AEHB63H6FDUTG3FGTUO6PCX2S6TQ,1594342351429,50,True,2020-07-10 00:52:31.429

You have to go to YouTube to find out how to actually use it.<br />The most annoying thing about the pedal is that the tempo control is a ""tap tempo"" button which is very awkward and difficult to dial in a tempo. A simple ""tempo dial"" would be a lot easier.<br />In general, for $100 I guess it's a decent unit but I've got a feeling there are better, more intuitive units out there.

It comes with a bag full of beginner goodies including a wonderful book to help you get started playing. It literally has everything you need to get started, a tuner too which is a nice bonus. For brand new players, they have also included silicone finger protecters which is a thoughtful addition for tender fingers that haven't toughened up yet. The strings are Aquila, a reputable name brand, and are very gentle on the fingers.<br /><br />The asthetics of this ukulele are very appealing. There is a sweet shaped headstock with a neat geographic pattern for extra interest. The body is a standard shape, very classic in style, and they colors are so vibrant! I chose the fuschia pink color and it is so pretty! It is so bright and cheerful!<br /><br />The sound is impressive on this soprano. It rings out nicely, and once the new strings settle, it is a blast to play this soprano... comfortable action, and the sustain is decent. It's quite enjoyable.<br /><br />To get started on ukulele, this is a great choice, and even for those who play a wide variety, this is a nice choice to add to any collection. There were some minor flaws in the body paint but very minor, and it was generally very tidy and attractive.

5.0,A good wireless microphone system based on price and performance !!,"Now, if I was considering upgrading from my simple wired microphone to a wireless one, I needed to find a good system, without having to break the bank, like those who are getting that expensive Rode or DJI microphone systems.<br /><br />The GGOWN is compact lightweight wireless microphone that will give you good quality audio for your Smartphone or DSLR videos. The transmitter is similar to the Rode Go, since it is a small and compact microphone that you can clip to your clothing. If you don‚Äôt like to use the built-in microphone on the transmitter, you can plug in a (included) Lavalier microphone instead. This can be less intrusive than the transmitter microphone and not as noticeable on clothing. You simply hide the transmitter in another location on your body, and you will be good to go.<br /><br />The whole system runs on the 2.4Ghz frequency, which seems to be the popular choice for this type of wireless microphone system. You shouldn‚Äôt have too many problems using it but you should be aware that this is a line-of-sight microphone. Don‚Äôt expect it to work miracles if you walk into another room. However, I tested it in open air at around 45 meters (150ft), and I never had any drop in connection.<br /><br />The microphone will pair right away with the receiver, as soon as both are powered on. There are not complicated buttons/functions to learn with this set. Just basics OFF/ON buttons, Mute/Bluetooth Accompaniment/reverbration integration button,<br />and volume ‚Äú+‚Äù and ‚Äú - ‚Äú.

4.0,Amazing Starter Set!,"First time buying a drum set? THIS IS A GOOD CHOICE!!<br />Here, I'll review from least important to most important:<br />The drum sticks which came with it had no finish, they feel like they were lathed and then directly packaged.<br />The drummer's throne (that's the seat) Is VERY strong! I have used it as a stepping stool, literally stood upright on it. The thing is DURABLE! Also, I find it very comfortable. I actually sit on it while i'm not playing drums.<br />The three toms really erk me, They have a nice descending sound to them. Powerful, but they vibrate A LOT! I strike the floor tom and hear it making the whole set vibrate. In my opinion I almost avoid the two mounted toms, they sound cheesy and leave the snare vibrating. Too much noise!!<br />The Bass drum is AWESOME! I threw a stuffed animal in there and I've been getting a solid thump out of it since. The bass petal is a great quality! I can make it hover next to the drum in case i want to hit it quickly (1/32nd of a beat actually!) Or i can keep it back to allow a more powerful strike! It's fun to mess around with the sounds of this bass drum. Add in a blanket or just a towel, I like hearing the different sounds this bass can offer!<br />Now the snare drum! This is my favorite snare drum! I've played on more expensive kits, and their snares sound really high, or too low, or they're so over powering you want to avoid touching the damn thing! This one offers my favorite snare sound! The metal chain can be quickly flipped up or down. (having it down makes it sound like a tom) When it is down, it's slightly lower than the highest tom on this kit.<br />The cymbals stand up to abuse! The whole set can be abused! Sometimes i play it as hard as I can and it doesn't seem to mind... VERY NICE SET (for the price)<br />The drums are made of some hardwood, and the skins are made of plastic. (when you first open the kit the plastic looks pathetic, but when you mount it and tighten up it's real strong~!)",[],B001PB3R6M,B001PB3R6M,AFV56AC557THA65TYLIWIMYI5YRA,1324356079000,5,True,2011-12-20 04:41:19.000

Most Karaoke machines have a loud announcer for switching modes. This one is moderate. I would honestly like to get another one for a balanced sound. The wireless mics in spite being cheap have a really really good signal projected to the machine (most likely why it eats batteries quickly).  I use the mic for singing and Talk Box.

5.0,"Amazing shells, Amazing internals, Amazing sound","I‚Äôm from the hometown where Eartech Music is located and heard about them through the community in which I live because of their association with a well respected local audiologist group.  I‚Äôve got several pairs of higher end headphones, amps, and dacs and enjoy listening to music.  While I had owned many other pairs of IEMs, this was my first pair of higher end IEMs.  I bought a set of their triple driver IEMs from Eartech Music and they are really the best audio fidelity comparable to my higher end headphones but easier to drive with mobile phones/DAPs.  They don‚Äôt have the openness of my airy cans (I don‚Äôt think any IEM could), but the isolation and accuracy of these triples are exceptional.  I‚Äôve seen the audio lab in which they are handmade and all their testing equipment.  Dollar for dollar when you look at audio equipment like speakers, high end head phones, I think you would be challenged to get better fidelity than these.  My only regret is because they are more expensive than many mass produced alternatives, I don‚Äôt take them out with me as much as I should.<br /><br />I wasn‚Äôt paid or given anything for this review, just love the product and supporting an American business with a passion for high quality audio.",[],B07ZZLS937,B07ZZLS937,AH2YIBH52XHDTSM3I3QHIJO44DIA,1573836663480,8,False,2019-11-15 16:51:03.480

4.0,Great Entry level DJ mixer!,"First impression:  Aesthetically bright and colorful, small, portable mixing device.<br /><br />Function: When powering on the FDuce mixer, the first thing you‚Äôll notice is a color show emanating from unit‚Äôs lighted dials, buttons and sliders.  The unit is small, 9.5‚Äù x 6‚Äù x 1‚Äùand is powered via a built-in rechargeable battery.  In the back are input/output ports and the emphasis here is on 1/8‚Äù plugs so don‚Äôt expect to use it to record your band‚Äôs next song.  This unit is really best suited as an entry level mixer for an up-and-coming DJ, creating a podcast, or if somehow you got hired to be the emcee at your cousin‚Äôs wedding.  With this little device and some practice, you could actually pull it off sounding like a pro.  Assisting you will be a number of mic and music inputs that can be blended and weaved together and also a special effects mixer keyboard.  The keyboard features 9-separate sound effects (including cheering, laughter, applause, ect.), a number of ways to manipulate the mic input voices such as raising/lowering the pitch, making it robotic sounding, ways to alter the sound output and the ability for you to custom program three voice or sound effects.<br />One of the most useful features of the mixer is that it operates as a stand-alone device utilizing the installed battery, or it can be plugged in when needed.<br /><br />Final verdict: A small, portable mixer, fitted with several 1/8‚Äù condenser mics inputs along with several audio inputs.  Multiple audio special effects along with mic and music blending dials allows practiced users the ability to create a semi-pro listening experience.  Not readily compatible with XLR inputs but does have the ability to export audio to a recording device. This is a great entry level device that is perfect to learn on and is priced accordingly.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vrx7u6bzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vrx7u6bzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vrx7u6bzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714nlIIEvaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714nlIIEvaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714nlIIEvaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BGN8NCDH,B0BGN8NCDH,AFN7TLKO5YF2DGRTUSGXQVCKS3FA,1669438882205,5,False,2022-11-26 05:01:22.205

Coiled wire is a bit bulky, but tolerable.  I do like that the 1/4&#34; adapter actually screws onto the 1/8&#34; to prevent accidental disconnect.  Overall, the sound quality is truly excellent.

5.0,More than a studio or gigging amp,"A few years ago my NAD power amp died after nearly 25 years of service; a good run for a fine piece of gear. Anyway, at the time my budget was very tight, so I deployed a Sansui integrated I had in the closet. That meant my Audio Research SP9II has been sitting unused--a shame because it's a fine late 80s preamp (and worth getting even now if you find one at a nice price). I recently decided to get the SP9II back in action, so I needed a power amp. But I still don't have funds for anything too pricey (meaning much above $400. Yeah, I know by audiophile standards that's petty change.) There's not a lot to choose from in that range. The little AudioSource amps get a lot of good reviews, but also a fair number of bad reviews. So I decided to check out the pro amps used by musicians and studios. Pyles were quite cheap, but not universally respected. Behringer was a possibility, but I know little about that company. Then I found the Crown XLS 1000 on sale for c. $250. The other amps in the series got solid reviews, the company was noted for rugged construction and high quality, and it had a good 3 yr. warranty. It was also a featherweight, under 10 lbs. (Appealing to me, with a dicky back.) Sold. When I hooked it into my Marantz CD changer & SP9II & satellite/sub system I immediately realized what I'd been missing with the Sansui (not a bad amp, but not exceptional). A semblance of soundstage opened up; dynamics improved notably; everything is just more vivid and detailed. The SP9II and the XLS 1000 make a terrific team. So, if you need a power amp for a home audio system, consider the XLS 1000. For a bit more money, the models higher in the line (1500, 2000, 2500) will give you more power. But I think if you're driving just a fairly efficient home speaker system (as I am), and you're an audio miser, this will do nicely for you. P.S. Since I wrote this review last winter, I've noticed that there's a bit of controversy about the use of pro amps in home audio systems. The concern is that your home pre-amp or pre-out (on your receiver or integrated amp) does not output a strong enough signal for professional amps like the XLS 1000. My SP9II happens to work fine with this Crown amp. The trick--according to an audio geek called Wayne Pflughaupt on Home Theater Shack, where he's written a veritable dissertation on the subject--is making sure your pre's output is equal to or greater than the sensitivity of the amp's input. In my case, the SP9II outputs 2 Vrms while the XLS 1000 has a sensitivity of 1.4 Vrms. So I'm good.",[],B003HZPKSM,B003HZPKSM,AEPC4SFRQF5DJ4A5LKJWNTHRJEHA,1298837853000,41,False,2011-02-27 20:17:33.000

5.0,Great value!,"If you are a drummer or if you want to be one, then a practice pad is a must. For practicing your drumming patterns, it is much quieter and much more portable than an actual snare drum. For this item, portability is made even more convenient because it comes with a zippered case with a handle, and even a pocket on the side to carry your drumsticks, of which two pair are included.<br /><br />My first impression of this pad was very favorable. I already own a 6‚Äù practice drum pad by a leading manufacturer of this type of item, and even though the the big name brand is a more expensive, I like this one better. It is double-sided, with two different surfaces. It has more of a bounce that I would expect from a real drum. In fact, I compared the bounce of both practice pads to my snare drum, and the Growdaily had a more realistic feel on the gray side. I have to say, I like the hard black pad on the name brand; however, for a realistic feel, which is what you want from a drum pad, in my estimation, the Growdaily is better. The black, harder surface on the Growdaily has more bounce, and is similar to the gray side, just more of a muted response. The gray (softer) side on the name brand is definitely different. The name brand‚Äôs gray side ‚Äúsounds‚Äù better, while the Growdaily sounds like you are hitting a block of wood; however, drum practice pads are not for sound, they are for feel and response so you can practice your snare drum patterns.<br /><br />There is only one thing I can say negative about this product, and it‚Äôs really a small thing. There are two slotted pockets to place the included drumsticks in, so you can carry them with you, which is great; however, I could only fit the included drumsticks into one pocket. The other was sewn too small for the included drumsticks to fit. Both sets of included drumsticks were size 5A. Oddly enough, another brand of drumsticks, also 5A, fit perfectly in the smaller pocket, but the 5As included with the drum practice pad definitely would not.<br /><br />In all, this is a great practice pad for a great value. I‚Äôd be happy with the practice pad alone. But, the added value of a carry pouch with a handle and pockets on the pouch for your sticks puts this item over the top in value.

5.0,I love it!!!,"Allright, I'm sure you're trying to figure out which capo to get. To some people, it's not a big deal making this decision. I look at a capo as another instrument and not as an accessory! This one does everything you need, easy to take out and put back in, pushes the strings in tightly, and (to me!) is better than the G7 (i think that's the name of it). The G7(?) is over 40 and it really does not give you the value it says it provides. What I mean by this is that it is an awesome capo but not worth over $25. However, this Kyser capo (in any color) is exactly what a guitarist looks for, which is perfect sound and the ability to switch frets at any given time!!! When I purchased this capo I was between this one and the G7(?)and I truly would have still purchased this one if the prices were the same. I'd MUCH rather get two of these for two of my guitars!!! However, don't forget, this is ultimately your OWN choice. Try both out, I know many people are very satisfied with the G7(?), but as an added benefit, Kyser has several colors to choose from, I got this gold one because it looks really nice with my acoustic and its strings. I hope this helped and keep playing :)",[],B0002CZSJY,B00CPLODUU,AEGNKBALXI5VWPTOXOQPFZF74YOA,1266103182000,5,True,2010-02-13 23:19:42.000

The sound is really good. You can choose whether you want black and gold or white and black. I chose the white and black. I definately feel like I'm back with professional equipment singing again.

5.0,Quite useful!,"Yes, the keyboard clatters, but its not overwhelming. Its an outgrowth of every key having its own sensor and the flat design offering both mono pressure sensing *and* VERY good polyphonic aftertouch. That's rare and extremely expressive for playing synths that respond to it. Its killer for string sections, for example. The modulation and pitch-bend buttons are pretty on-off for me. If delicate shadings are high on your list, look elsewhere; its not a replacement for a standard wheel or a stick, as neither is truly smooth to use. The pitch is more on the order of a sudden whole step up or down.<br /> On the upside, the sustain button and octave shifts are quite responsive and the keyboard is off the charts for sensitivity. I can do crisp trills & flutters on it that take more effort elsewhere. There is also a multi-platform editor you can download for free. Part of that is complex enough that I'll mostly live with the XKey as is, but its still useful in a couple of places. Most of all, it feels solid. I won't be giving up my standard keyboards, but when I'm just writing or laying down a more detailed part, it proves its worth. Its too short for me at just 2 octaves, but the word is that there is a 37-key model in the pipeline. Since you can run up to four of these from one powered hub, I can easily see stacking a pair of them. I've only had it since Xmas, so we'll see how it holds up, but I'm liking it a lot for a guy who usually gives these things the Stinkeye. It feels better than any of the other budget controllers I've played, so don't dismiss it.

It comes in a case with an extra wind screen and it also comes with multiple adaptors for different types of sound systems.

4.0,You get what you pay for,"I bought this device in order to play bass in a band I'm in using a 2-octave midi keyboard, while my should recovers from major surgery.  Upon testing I was disappointed in the bass sounds.  Most of them have a very heavy ""attack"" on the leading edge of their waveform that is not realistic to a true bass guitar or stand-up bass.  Consequently I spent a lot of time trying to find an android app alternative to use with my Samsung S7 smartphone.  Extensive testing resulted in two apps being purchased: FluidSynth MIDI, and Walk Band, as having good bass sounds.  However, being software, these have inherent issues (latency, crashes, limitations, etc.), and it's not possible to charge the phone while using it to play live.  So I have settled on this being my live performance keyboard bass.  It can be charged while using, but the 2500 mah battery lasts for hours sans recharging.  As for the sounds, I'm using #34 and #35.  One can actually use other instruments such as the nylon guitar, transposed down one octave for a bass that sounds pretty good without the heavy attack waveform.  Bottom line, this turned out to be a good and inexpensive solution for my needs.  It turns any MIDI keyboard into a basic synthesizer.  Unfortunately sound samples can't be uploaded into the device, but the built-in sounds are workable.

2.0,Unplayable... but...,"DESIGN ISSUES.  This is a different, beginner-level instrument.  It is intended for beginners, somewhat a ""campfire"" instrument.  It is not possible to use this instrument for intermediate or advanced playing.  The reason is that it is in the key of D... which is fine for most Celtic / folk-style music, but is not the standard C found on regular flutes.  While a C-foot is available, the intermediate / advanced level B-foot is not available.  Thus one will not be able to play all flute music with this flute.<br /><br />WILL PLAY MOST MUSIC BUT NOT ALL.  Still to be fair, this flute in D will play most Celtic / folk music, and with the optional C-foot would cover the majority of non-orchestral music.  The key really isn't a major problem, as most flute players usually start with an inexpensive C flute and then advance to an open-hole B flute once they progress (requiring the purchase of a new instrument anyway).  But without the C-foot, standard orchestral music that uses the middle-C note will not be playable.  The C foot is not included and increases the price significantly.<br /><br />A MAJOR PROBLEM.  While the upper basic register on the Nuvo flute worked well and sounded great (left hand keys), I could not get the lower notes to play at all (right hand keys).  It felt as if the pads were not seating correctly but it was difficult to tell.  No matter how hard I pressed the keys, the issue did not resolve itself.  I recognize this could simply be a ""lemon factor"" of one unit that came off the line... but do they not test these before shipping them out?<br /><br />I can't say I'm really enthusiastic about the D-head design of this flute.  It feels a bit breathy (requiring more air).  The fingering on this seems a bit sluggish, and both fingering and aperture were not as responsive as a metal concert flute (but then I didn't get a good chance to test that).  The advantages are low-cost, small size, light weight, and durability.  I'd have to find one that works to judge further as to playing style and quality.<br /><br />I'm giving this two stars rather than one because 1) Maybe I got a lemon and 2) The accessories are great.  First, the case is fantastic.  I was expecting a cheap plastic slip-over case.  No, this case seems to be made out of thick leather (or a close artificial equivalent).  It is padded with heavy foam and snaps shut.  The grease that comes with this is some cream-type compound I haven't seen before, and far superior to basic cork wax (they should sell this stuff separately).  All of the accessories are high-quality, and the flute itself seems very well-made and sturdy (except for the fact I couldn't get the lower notes to play).<br /><br />The tones of the notes I could get to play were quite nice and pleasing to the ear.  If the entire flute had played as well I would likely have been satisfied-- for a 'play around' flute.  Because of the thick ABS this is made from, one should not expect to get the crystal-bell high tones one would find in a quality metal flute... but then we're not paying three grand for the instrument either.  The price is dirt cheap for a musical instrument (taking it for granted one can get music out of it).<br /><br />So for the one I received, low ratings.  If I were a beginner I would think the problem was all me and spend weeks trying to get this to work... and finally give up on flute playing forever.  As it stands I know the problem isn't me, this flute simply didn't play well.

Also the Kala had an incredibly hard time staying in tune, despite stretching the strings, where the Lohanu once tuned, kept tune for a reasonable amount of time.  Only issues I found were a couple cosmetic issues on the fretboard. I sent the company the feedback to let them know, and they wanted to make sure they made it right and are sending me two prior returned ukes and I can keep the current one!  They offered to send me a brand new one, but since these were cosmetic issues, I felt better having them send me ukes they couldn't sell.

1.0,Impossibly Quiet-- to the point of uselessness.,"Maybe I got a bad one, but I can hardly hear myself. I'm running Audacity on Windows 8.1, I have speakers set to 100%, microphone set to 100%, and am speaking normally from about 4 inches away. Yet the volume is so ridiculously quiet, it's basically pointless. Yes, I can hear what I'm recording, but I wanted to get this for audiobook narration in a relatively noisy room, but I can't very well read a book while I'm trying to swallow a microphone (since that's how close it has to be to my mouth to hear anything.) I'm thinking mine must be defective, because I see people making videos with it from 6 to 10 inches away and their videos sound fine. I'm not sure whether I should return it or not.<br /><br />EDIT: Update: I read some reviews about how the microphone stand and the microphone itself has a strong chemical odor. I said, ""Ehh, how bad could it be?"" And when I opened it, I told myself it wasn't so bad. The next day, when my wife and I came home and walked through the door, we both stared at each other in horror wondering what foul thing could have made our apartment smell like a rancid combination of acid and death.

3.0,"Sounds Good, Software could use some work.","The M Game Solo is pretty good, it has the ability to hear both PC and console at the same time which is exactly what I was looking for. (via usb for PC and via optical for console, but you need an HDMI audio extractor with optical out for PS5 though). The XLR Mic input does seem to have a bit of noise if you max out the gain, but if you lower it a bit then it sounds fine. There are better options for that though. The audio coming to my headphones sounds perfect, no complaints (32Bit 48Khz on PC). The sliders on the unit could be a bit smoother, but it's not really an issue for me. The only complaint about the physical unit I have is that certain things don't have an LED, so I have to turn on a light to see what I'm touching sometimes. The software is kind of buggy, some settings wouldn't save and required a restart of the software. To even be able to download the software (and get the driver required, you have to register the device on the product site which is absolutely terrible.

3.0,Adequate but not best for the money,"This is a two-channel amp with a fan, typically used in a PA system where the fan noise is not necessarily a problem.<br /><br />Home Theatre (look elsewhere for value)<br /><br />It makes no sense to use this in a home theatre system. You can easily get less expensive Class D amp without a fan that is better suited to home theatre. For example, the Wyred4Sound 7 channel amp is $228 per channel and this Crown amp is $365 per channel. The Wyred4Sound amps sound at least as clean as these Crown amps.<br /><br />Wattage (a highly misleading specification)<br /><br />Crown presents the rated wattage into 4 Ohms. This is stated in the product information, but many people may not be aware that the industry standard approach is to present the rated wattage into 8 Ohms, so this would compare to about a 380 watt amp (as far as that meaningless information goes).<br /><br />However, loudspeakers typically use less than 1 watt at normal listening levels of 85-90 dB. For big thumps like a drum, the amp needs to provide a bit more. I owned 1000 watt class D amp (like this Crown amp but almost 3x more wattage and more expensive) and replaced it with a 30 watt tube amp. The 30 watt amp had better bass and sounded better overall. It is the quality of the first watt that makes the difference.

2.0,Wears about after about 6 months.,"I have had this for about 6 months now and the stand does a few things well except for what it needs to do well. In other words, the arms are fine but the base is sub-par. The part that clamps to the desk is not engineered correctly at all. There is a small nub that goes into the base from the boom and it should be about 1.5"" longer at least. This way it can effectively reduce the amount of sway in the mic.<br /><br />The mic sways a LOT in the base, so if you are trying to adjust the mic an inch here or there it is not easy, it sways about 4 inches before you can adjust it! So you have to think about how you want to adjust it instead of just moving the mic.<br />The main problem is that the base of the unit is cheap, it needs to be thicker, when you tighten the screw to secure the base the lower part of the base, where the screw screws into it, bends down. So the base deforms as you tighten it and cannot get tight enough. It works but it is not great.",[],B07GVJSQF6,B07GVJSQF6,AE25AHCR76SO5IM2LHLQNWIROE6Q,1572359605030,0,True,2019-10-29 14:33:25.030

5.0,Vic Firth X5BN - Excellent sticks and perfect match for both acoustic and electronic drum sets.,"The Vic Firth X5BN are the perfect match for acoustic and electronic drums.  Acoustic because the nylon tips sound great on the drum heads and crisp and clean on the ride cymbal and hi-hats.  Electronic because the nylon tips will not ruin mesh heads (e.g. Roland TD20).  Gone are the days of having to roll sticks on a counter at the store to see if they are warped or checking the ""V's"" on the tip end for potential splitting problems.  Every Vic Firth stick I've purchased were straight from the start.  I've also never had a stick that split on the ""V"".

2.0,Great Price But Not Quite Right... Returned,"This looked good and sounded good. The nut slots were not cut deep enough. Which made playing too difficult.

This is not for a beginner unless you cut the slots deeper.<br /><br />I returned it because of this problem.<br /><br />Since ordering this I now own many files. If I bought another one of these I could adjust the string slot depth to make it playable. Only then would I be able to know if the intonation were good or close. On most inexpensive ukuleles and acoustic guitars the intonation is off. So much so that when playing on the higher frets, the notes sound out of tune. This happens on $300+ ukuleles too. Just not as bad.<br /><br />The package includes everything needed.

4.0,Good Package for the $20 I paid...,"I'm not sure it is worth the $40+ it is being offered at now.<br /><br />The good of this game is that it is the first Hockey game to really capture the Wii experience.  I purchased this specific bundle because it came with 2 Hockey sticks, which is perfect for my wife and I or any visitors.<br /><br />The setup is a bit challenging, but once you have it set-up, you play the game with stick controls that feel about as real as one can get in a video game.  The game play is fantastic and fun.  The skill levels are set up nicely to work your way up to more challenging play.  The pee-wee mode is fantastic for 2 people to play in a pick-up game type setting.<br /><br />When you get to the junior and pro levels, there are a nice selection of teams available including AHL, CHL, IHL, Olympic teams, and of course NHL.  The negative is that the rosters are becoming out-dated and the updates have stopped.  Of course, if a person is more concerned about realism or graphics, they probably should be going with the more mainstream games or another system.  It's just an unfortunate situation where the Wii seems to get the left-overs when it comes to sports games.  Then again, game-play can be more important, and this game succeeds in that regard.<br /><br />I do like that in the 5 on 5 situations there is some flexibility in the rules.  The player can choose how off-sides is called, how icing is called, and how often penalties can occur.  The length of periods is flexible, which is enjoyable.  The only flaws I see revolve around what seems to be an inability of the user to change the lines as seen fit.  I also don't like that the user can't pull his own goalie.  I haven't fully investigated the career or season modes, so perhaps this flexibility comes into play there, although I don't see why it would.<br /><br />The only other comment I have is that the controller situation with the stick makes it very difficult to utilize your remotes for getting into the game and removing/replacing the remote in the stick.  The compartment for storing the excess cable is a bit tight.  Removing the head of the stick gets the user the ability to use the remote in a traditional way, but it can still be a bit inconvenient.<br /><br />You can play the game with just the controller and nun-chuck (i.e. without the hockey stick housing), but at that point the purpose of the game seems a bit defeated.  It is only unfortunate that the plastic hockey-stick housing costs over $20.  It makes the game seem a bit prohibitive for expanding out to a full 4 people situation in terms of cost.<br /><br />All that being said, I really think the game was a great value at $20.  I probably would love it just the same at $40, but I know it took the $20 price-point to convince me to buy it.  I definitely wouldn't spend $40 if you don't get the second stick.  A huge part of the fun is playing with others.  Get good at setting up one-timers and teamwork, and you'll see just how great this game can be.",[],B005N0I6BW,B005N0I6BW,AGNXBNFVK55XMNEGUUVN4GBHKMEQ,1324405974000,4,True,2011-12-20 18:32:54.000

The corners kept catching on the stings and this resulted in pulling the picks off of my fingers. Even though the picks fit, they're hard to keep in place when playing.

5.0,Much Better Than Expected!!!,"I don't even know where to start with this mic!  Had been looking at it for a few weeks, as I was needing a true condenser mic for my home studio that would work with my M-Audio audio interface.  After a frustrating recording session, (where my Samson Track Pro mic was fighting with the audio interface causing, all kinds of static, or complete lack of signal all together) I decided to pull the trigger on Marantz MPM-1000 microphone.<br /><br />To start, Amazon crushed it with the delivery!  The product was on my door step exactly 3 hours after placing my order!  The box is well packaged and arrived in perfect condition, despite being shipped in the product box.  First impressions is that this is a real solid product and well made for the incredibly affordable price.  After hooking it up and recording a few backing vocal tracks (with zero sound insolation), the vocals were crisp and clear.  Very comparable to the Samson Track Pro, dare I say, even better sounding.  A few days later I recorded the vocals for a new song, and was insanely impressed with the sound it reproduced!  As a death metal vocalist, most times, a cheap mic cannot handle the high SPL's of metal vocals.  However, my vocals came out crystal clear, with full range of tone.<br /><br />I really can't stress how awesome of a mic this is for only $60.

2.0,Time for a redesign,"I've been disappointed with Behringer 100% of the time I've bought something from them. Production quality is questionable, support is non-existent, and they just keep cycling through old ideas with minimal innovation - competing solely on price.<br /><br />This design is decades old and it wasn't that great to begin with. My main gripe: although this has a kind of sub-group (Alt 3-4), the only way to assign to it is with the mute button...they made the mute button a sub group assign button. My goal was this: I wanted to use my studio monitors as my main speakers and have a floor monitor for vocals while rehearsing. I wanted the floor monitor to have reverb. This thing has built in effects and a sub-group with dedicated outs, right? Except that the sub-groups are assigned using mutes, so it's not an A/B/Y selection, it's an A/B. I tried with multiple configurations, including burning a stereo track as an aux return, but nothing I tried worked.<br /><br />Anyway, whatever. Reconfigured my studio and got rid of the floor monitor. Fast forward and I have 4 synths and my computer output. Now 4 out of 6 faders are lost to just two synths because channels 1-4 are mono; whatever, I knew that when I bought it. So 4 synths (1-4 mono, 5-8 stereo) no problem because this board is USB and won't burn inputs for my computer...nope! The USB is absolute rubbish. If I play music off of iTunes or whatever, the song will play fine and then when it ends there will be a loud crackle (like someone ran into a record player), a pause, and then another loud crackle before the next song. EVERY SINGLE TIME. I think the USB interface is like going to sleep or something? I've been making music for 20 years now, never seen anything like it.<br /><br />TL;DR:<br />- The design itself is needlessly flawed and could have been fixed with 6 more buttons decades ago.<br />- The mono-to-stereo ratio is kind of lame for keyboards. Can't they just make every channel switchable between mono/stereo by now?<br />- The USB is useless to me.<br />- Behringer won't fix this until Arturia designs something better and then Behringer will rip them off.<br />- Bought recently and already looking for something else.",[],B0039PPW60,B0039PPW60,AHE4VJJGSHQN3J7UHPPARFSYVRQQ,1675454593638,0,True,2023-02-03 20:03:13.638

So coming from that place I think this thing is terrific. It appears well built and well designed. It has a cool factor too imo. The construction is solid not cheap and it has metal parts like the band above the nut that looks like it protects the top of the guitar very well. All the metal parts are finished in a grayish bronze look. The finger board doesn‚Äôt look like wood but it looks very professional what ever material it is..<br />The Mahogany body looks solid and robust. The wood finish is clean, even and appears to be professionally done. Not slapped on like some finishes on less expensive products.<br />The sound is subjective of coarse. The provided ear buds are basic. The on board electronics are basic. But with better earphones the sound improves drastically. Overall this guitar feels great and plays nicely. It‚Äôs comfortable and easy to hold. Unlike other travel/practice units I‚Äôve had that slide around or have to be strapped to play.<br />The guitar is what it is. It‚Äôs a inexpensive travel/practice unit and I don‚Äôt expect a lot from it.<br />As you can tell I was pleasantly surprised and am enjoying the guitar very much‚Ä¶<br />To sum it up‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ this unit looks and feels very well made and is fun to play.

4.0,A few notes about this purchase,"I recently purchased this Ibanez guitar in the Flat black color scheme, and the guitar is absolutely beautiful. Looking at the picture it appears to have silver/chrome trim, but it is actually a gold color scheme. I purchased it as a beginners guitar after reading many reviews, and listening to it on video.<br /><br />For $449 I wasn't expecting the sound quality of a $2500 gibson, but I have to say that I wasn't totally impressed with the sound quality overall. I have played in bands before as a keyboardist, and I know what a quality guitar should sound like.<br /><br />Just be aware that there is a noticeable difference between a high end guitar compared to the lower priced Ibanez. Adding some quality strings and running it through EQ would probably help quite a bit. I also felt like there wasn't enough range on the volume and tone knobs.<br /><br />Overall, a decent guitar but I returned this item, and will wait to purchase a higher end guitar in the future.",[],B01N2145N9,B073639MWM,AHGN57UESKXJAPWDEZKAQGJFATUQ,1638459931477,13,True,2021-12-02 15:45:31.477

Couple the material with the color and, seriously, it looks like a traffic cone is sticking out of your horn.  But it sounds good on the large bore.

5.0,Definitely worth the money,"This is the first saber I‚Äôve bought outside of Wal-Mart quality stuff but I‚Äôm really impressed. It is a good quality for the price.

The ‚Äúlock up‚Äù feature wasn‚Äôt explained at all but I figured out that it is to simulate you and your opponent locking blades. I love the realistic length. It doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm holding a toy for a kid, it feels like a real replica. The one bad thing I could mention is that the sound/flash that activates when striking things isn‚Äôt very responsive. You have to hit pretty hard to activate it and then there‚Äôs a 1-2 second delay before it will do it again. That doesn‚Äôt seem like a long time on paper but in the moment it feels like a long time. It basically activates every 3rd hit or so. Overall  I‚Äôm super happy with the quality and already bought another one so I can make a double bladed saber.<br /><br />*update* I bought a second saber in a separate transaction but couldn‚Äôt find the connector online. The one that someone shared on the ‚Äúquestions‚Äù section was male to male but in order to connect these sabers you need a female to female connector.

5.0,Really Great Amp!!,"I was looking for a good, powerful amp to replace my Peavey which only had about 160 watts.  Played many expensive amps and found that the Behringer BX4500H 450-Watt Bass Amp Head had more power and better tone than amps twice the price. Some musicians look down at Behringer, but for the life of me, I cannot figure out why.  This amp was cleaner sounding than the Hartke I tried and on par with the Gallien-Krueger with similar specs, at half the price.  It comes with a foot pedal for the Ultrabass which takes you an octave lower, and the Shape function, which I find useful if you need a different sound for a certain song or if you are changing basses or soloing.  This Behringer amp is equipped  with a unique Dynamizer preamp circuitry that gives you a lively and punchy sound with signal peaks--even if the amp reaches its power limits. Extreme signal peaks are limited effectively while the average level and hence the power of the overall signal is raised. The sound gets more vivid and powerful in character, without any unmusical distortion. With its limiter in the power stage it is virtually impossible to overdrive the ULTRABASS BX4500H.<br /><br />Some of the Specs:<br />Extremely powerful 450-Watt bass amplifier head<br />Dynamizer technology for ultimate punch and to capture every nuance of your playing<br />Switchable Ultrabass subharmonics processor for unbelievable low-end power<br />Revolutionary Shape filter for extreme sound range<br />Dedicated 5-band EQ with Bright and Deep functions for awesome sound shaping<br />Musical limiter for ultimate volume without distortion<br />Vintage-style VU meter for precise signal level control<br />Dual footswitch for Ultrabass and Shape functions included<br />Balanced DI output for direct connection to your mixing console<br />Dedicated Tuner Output/Effect Send and separate Line output for additional flexibility<br />FX Insert for external effects devices (stomp boxes, rack effects, etc.)<br />3 speaker outputs on 1/4'' jack and professional speaker connectors (compatible with Neutrik Speakon connectors)<br />Active, temperature-controlled cooling system for ultimate protection<br />High-quality components and exceptionally rugged construction ensure long life<br /><br />I've had this amp for about 4 months and have played several gigs of different sizes and this amp has proven itself.  Other musicians check it out and at least one I know of has bought this amp to replace a more popular brand.  I've, in the last couple of years, revisited my love for bass playing after a 30 year hiatus.  Call it my mid life crisis, cheaper than a red Porsche!

The neck and shoulder pain was getting to me. Different shoulder rests. No shoulder rest. Foam shoulder support. New chin rests. Chin rest pads. This is one option I tried. It didn't work for me but that doesn't mean it won't work for others. I use it occasionally with double stick tape for a temporary attachment. It is well made and provided a nice cushion. However, I needed to learn to not clamp down with my chin, which was the core problem, so for now I'm not using it. But I kept it just in case.<br /><br />I've posted this review almost identically on all the products that I went through.<br /><br />Where I've ended up is with a sponge as a shoulder rest.

I wish I could play without a shoulder rest at all but I have a tall neck and my shoulder is narrow and slopes quickly away. For my chin to even touch the chin rest without a shoulder pad I have to really crank my neck down. Not good. I had been taught years ago as a kid to use a shoulder rest and clamp down on it with my chin. Now I'm reversing that and holding the violin up with my left hand while I play. The chin lightly touches on the chin rest but my head and neck are in line with my spine and I don't have to bend my neck down. So my head can move freely while I play. The thick sponge shoulder pad keeps me from the reflex of pulling my left shoulder up while I play. I'm much more comfortable playing now even though I have to learn everything over again. It's amazing how much freer my movement is with the head not clamping down. The violin and my head can move more easily with the context of the music.<br /><br />The sponge does change the tonal quality of the violin. But I just play for myself--I'm not in an orchestra or playing for the public, so it doesn't really matter.<br /><br />This product may work for others, so I wanted to explain my story and let you know that I didn't choose to use it for reasons other than quality of manufacture or design.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DB7NwO62L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DB7NwO62L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DB7NwO62L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B002Z88RJ6,B07RLYS9NY,AGYPL4M6CEUTTKLDJBIQYRJUBRYA,1631018438108,3,True,2021-09-07 12:40:38.108

2.0,"Unplugged its nice, problems with pickup, especially for lead players","I don't like giving a negative review to Martin, especially since I am a big fan of the company. I own 5 Martins and have been using them for professional live performance for over a decade. That said, the Fishman electronics that come in these (and in the Little Martin series guitars) are extremely inconsistent from guitar-to-guitar. Example: I own three different Little Martins...1 LXME and two (supposedly identical) LX1E. The one I have been using for live performance as my primary instrument seems to be a ""unicorn""...clear, loud signal, balanced nicely with equal volume across all strings. The other two guitars are much quieter when plugged in, and both sound ""thinner"" and more trebly...not ideal at all for live performance. Back to the 000-Jr Series: I purchased one of these and was pretty impressed before I plugged it in. Nice, big sound (unplugged) compared to the Little Martins, neck felt good and it played fine. I bought this guitar with the intention of using it as my primary gigging guitar...an upgrade to the Little Martins. I am tall and the Little Martins kind of always felt a little too small and it looked like I was playing a ukulele in pictures, so I was excited to upgrade to a bigger/better instrument that was not so expensive (like if something happened to damage it at a bar gig, it isn't quite the disaster that damaging a really nice/expensive guitar would be). Its an ""auditorium"" size/style and the cutaway is great for lead players, significantly larger than a 3/4 size (like the Little Martins) but much smaller than a dreadnought. ALL THAT SAID...when I plugged it in, the volume differences b/w the strings was so out-of-wack that it as completely unusable for live performance. the low E string was quiet and the A string was twice as loud. UNACCEPTABLE.<br /> I totally understand with the piezo pickups, there can be inconsistent volume if its not set up perfectly balanced and even, but this was just terrible. So I took it to my guitar tech/certified luthier. He improved it but when I got it back, there were volume imbalances in new areas (on other strings).<br /> I finally sent the guitar back and ordered a new one, exact same model.<br /> It arrived and I was excited, thinking I probably got a bad/flawed model. Nope, same exact issues with the new one. So, I took it to my guitar tech again....he tried his best to make it even and balanced but it wasn't possible to fix.<br /> FINAL CHAPTER, I recently purchased an LR Baggs Element pickup...a much nicer pickup than the Fishman pickup these Martins come with. Got my tech to remove the Fishman and cut a hole in the side of the guitar to install the LR Baggs. Just got it back, super excited to start performing with it.<br /> It now sounds leagues better than how it sounded before (with the Fishman electronics) BUT, there is a noticeable drop-off in volume, as well as a much ""tinier"" thin sound on only the high E string....which is a huge bummer when you play lead. I loop at my live shows and use the high E string as the most climatic part of some of my guitar solos. I loop throughout the show so I am playing lead guitar a good portion of each show. Couldn't even make it through a full show, had to switch back to the (only) Little Martin (of the three that I own that sounds acceptable to use for live performance).<br /> Of Note: if you only play rhythm guitar this is probably just fine to use at shows, and its not a bad purchase for the price point. HOWEVER, if you play lead or chord voicings that are higher up the neck on the higher-pitched strings, I would spend more on a higher-quality instrument.<br /> These are made in Mexico (no problem with that), but it sure seems like Martin has, as a company over the last few years, settled for outsourcing cheaper guitars with VERY NOTICEABLE DROP IN QUALITY.<br />I used to feel like even the middle and lower-tier Martins were still in line with a certain barometer in overall quality, but now that I own five different Martins that fit in that category, its mainly led to frustration for me as a professional. I mean, why make ""affordable"" acoustic-electric guitars that consistently fail the live-performance test. Very disappointing in my opinion. If you're trying to buy this to travel with or play for fun (unplugged) at the house, I do actually recommend this instrument. But if you plan to buy this as an affordable instrument to actual use for live performance, I would avoid it at all costs.<br />Worth mentioning. The first two Little Martins I purchased came with a thick, nicely-padded (still a soft case but very sturdy/good padding) gig bag. Starting with the third Martin (through the most recent purchase) they have switched to a much much less-protective, super thin with very poor padding) cheaper gig bag that basically just keeps it from getting scratched. It doesn't protect your guitar....which is super-disappointing. Its like Martin actively made that decision for a big dip in quality, just to save maybe a few bucks per case.<br /> I used to rave to my musician friends about how awesome the included gig bag was. The gig bags they've been including over the last few years are straight up garbage.<br /> I realize buying a guitar online without being able to test it puts you at risk, but dealing with a company as prestigious as Martin is/was, its extremely disappointing to buy six guitars of there's (including the one I returned), with only one of them really passing the test for acceptable use for live performance. Hope this helps some of you from making the same mistake I did",[],B07V3G21HX,B07V3G21HX,AGTOTDKQKE5LVJAZWHF5DVOVLDKQ,1673794178458,2,True,2023-01-15 14:49:38.458

The end of the heal would need to be mounted closer to the bridge that a regular 21 or 22 fret necks.<br /><br />In my case the heel was simply too narrow.  I was looking to mount it on a number of bodies 24 fret bodies, or bodies made for necks that mount with more unfretted heel, at about where 23rd fret would be.  I couldn't find a body in my stash that would work with this heel, that measured about 54.85mm.

I picked up an Epi Goth '58 Explorer and just wasn't satisfied with the clarity of the stock pups, but loved the guitar, as it plays nearly as well as my Gibson SG Standard. I ordered this to deal with the tone suck and to accommodate the generally wider string spacing at the bridge position with the Tune-O-Matic stop bar. The outer strings are a little off-center, but it is unnoticeable unless you're being nitpicky. I assume it looks better than the regular Custom humbucker. You might want a regular humbucker for the neck position if swapping both.<br /><br />As far as tones, I slammed this thing in the bridge with the stock hardware and, boy, does it scream!!! It lets the Explorer maintain that vintage tone, but with a modernized vibe, and accentuates the mahogany body of the guitar. I ran this through my Helix and it sounds absolutely incredible. A warm, yet tight vintage tone with an aggressive bite. Perfect for the tonal flavors I'm into.<br /><br />I highly recommend this pickup for the Epi Goth '58 Explorer, and Duncan pickups in general.

5.0,Nice for the price point,"Definitely an AT.  Or a darned great copy. AT logo right on the stylus grip.  Good starter cart for the super budget-minded.  The stylus probably won't last long and replacements are as expensive as this little combo is new.  But, still, it sounds good and plays a pretty wide variety of records at 2 grams tracking force with authority.  You might even think it's a pricier cart in a blind test, except distortion is just a tad higher, but not enough to worry about compliance issues and groove damage.  I firmly believe, even your best vinyl still will be safe under this stylus.  It's not the finest, but it's a huge step up over non-compliant ceramics and other cheesy carts and stylus combos on the market today.  With a genuine metal cantilever and good angle of attack to the surface via vertical tracking angle, it's very decent.  Merchant warns this is a low hour stylus, but I haven't played it enough to confirm that yet.  So far, not a bad little cart to have in the headshell box for those non-mission critical jobs like needle dropping yard sale records.

3.0,It's okay is the best title I can think of.,"It's okay is the best title<br /><br />The sole purpose for this capo was for my Martin LX1. First I broke my thumbnail trying to open it; the reason this is an issue is I am a fingerpicker and constantly trying to grow my nails. But not the reason I am not 100% happy with it.<br /><br />For the most part it works which I can't say for the Keyser Capo clamp versions. I still think my G7th Capo is by far the best. But I really wanted a dedicated capo for this guitar to sit on the guitar or at least in the case I put it in. So based on a FB review I decided to try it.<br /><br />Once I got it on it's okay, but still think it's a tad clunky. It does fit behind the nut but at an angle. So any chord I do while not using it I have to deal with it touching my hand which I am not a fan of; but it's not so much where it effects my playing.<br /><br />If I could do it all over again I would have not bought this and tried a different clamp capo. The reason I don't want another G7th is by design I can't clamp and unclamp/clamp to the head of my guitar which I like to do when I don't want to have to reach for something.

I do know that I have trouble tying the strings on my newly-acquired Cordoba.  I stumbled across these while looking for new strings, and decided to give them a try.  First, they do what they say they'll do, they make it easier to securely tie your strings, prevent damage to the bridge and provide a consistent string angle between the holes in the bridge and the saddle.  As another reviewer mentioned, it makes the angle behind the saddle steeper because the loop in the string isn't pulling up on the string any more.  This should lessen the tendency of the strings to deflect laterally on the saddle.<br /><br />I was able to install these without changing strings because there was enough string looped around the rollers and the string of the now-unnecessary knots was available.<br /><br />They look like they were made on a 3D printer, mine have a matte black finish that seems a little less shiny than the picture.

A right handed regular mouse in your right hand with a right side boom mic will likely clack like THUNDER straight into the mic, forcing you to manually clean up the first and last fraction of a second on any recording...gets real old, real fast.

I practiced with a YouTube video only playing back octaves of C# and my recorded didgeridoo tones match the tone exactly. I have also started using my voice to create tone harmonics and various octaves of C# or even  notes in the key of C# (C‚ôØ, D‚ôØ, E‚ôØ, F‚ôØ, G‚ôØ, A‚ôØ, and B‚ôØ.) I  have not mastered circular breathing so I can only make the tones in single breaths. The tones sound great and the instrument is fun to play. Just be aware that its in the key of C#. It's important to know if you plan on playing multiple instruments or in a small band.  Also, this unit does not come with a carrying case - I'll need to make one or buy one to make it easier to transport when I take it to the parks to play outdoors.

4.0,"Best Deal for PC Sound at the Price, MAudio Killer","I have used MAudio AV40s for my home PC for four years, and love the sound fidelity and power, but I admit that I am rather suprised that my 40s lated as long as they have, as the rear of the speaker with the amp in it gets hot enough to fry an egg, and there is a doubt producing ""THUMP"" whenever they are powered off. Nevertheless, they are impressive speakers.<br /><br />When my old Creative T20s at work died, I considered getting an AV30 to replace them, but the many complaints of sudden death from users of that product and my own concerns over the AV40s created some doubts. Even worse, some reviews mention the new 20 Watt AV30s sound worse than the older models do. I decided to try somemthing from another maker, especially since at 10W per channel, the AV30 Mk II has no power advantage over its many competitors as the older 15W per channel MkIs did. (Though what's 5 Watts anyway, but that's another topic...)<br /><br />The Akai RPM3s are an excellent buy, and indeed appear to be the exact same speaker as the Alesis M1 Actives 320 USB, rebadged, in a different color scheme, and without selectable voltage, so check reviews for those speakers for other perspectives.<br /><br />Akai has minimal specs on their website, a trait shared with Alesis, and is sadly unresponsive to product inquiries. What I can discern from what is offered and my own observations is this: 10 Watts X 2, 3"" woofer, 1"" tweeter, speakers appear to be MDF, weigh about 3 lbs apiece. Amplifier class not identifed, minimal heat production suggests a Class D (no more egg frying as with MAduios A/B amps...)1 year warranty (though hopefully Akai responds to warranty claims with greater attention than they do to product spec inquiries...)<br /><br />Subjectively, these sound great, though the much vaunted USB interface did not work. On my PC, using the USB codec produced huge difference in sound from left speaker to right, to the extent that I though the right speaker had come out of the box blown. Switching over to the usual 1/8"" inch plug produced normal balanced sound. No idea what the problem is here, but it could well be my junky work supplied PC, but USB use enthusiasts be forewarned...<br /><br />Similarly, as I did not use the USB recording interface, I have no idea how that works. The speaker has a full roster of inputs on the back of the right (amped) satellite. The included cables are very short. The speakers are connected with 1/8"" wire, not speaker wire, and the cord is only about 2 feet long, so near field only use is the deal unless you get a longer 1/8"" cable. Also, there is no PC to speaker 1/8"" included, so if the PC USB to speaker interface does not work for you, as it did not work for me, you will need another 1/8"" cable to make the alternate soundcard connection.<br /><br />Sound (once properly connected) is excellent. I played everything to test these little guys from death metal to jazz piano to classical guitar and it was all impressive. These are near-field speakers, so they have a sweet spot and will not fill a large room with thunderous sound, but if you are sitting at a desk and do not want to deafen yourself, these are plenty loud. (I like my music louder than most, but use these at only 30% volume and is more than enough for me.) Bass is a bit less than the AV40s, but midrange and treble is roughly comparable.<br /><br />If you are buying PC speakers to listen mostly to music, I doubt you will be unhappy with these. With Logitech's spurious claims of 200 RMS watt plastic speaker based systems that produce 75% of their sound from the sub, you may be tempted to go with something that costs more, thumps more, and is all plastic, but trust me, a real woofer / tweeter 2 way wooden speaker design with 20 honest watts of output will amaze you. Especially if you mainly listen to music. Compared to the Creative T20s, the Akai's beat them in all areas of sound, and cost 20% less. The Logitech Z623 (which I owned briefly) costs close to twice as much as these, and though it produces more thumping, is certainly much worse for musical playback.<br /><br />I would highly recommend these for people looking for speakers less than a C note, and for music fans. Akai loses points for not giving full specs or responding to customer emails, and the non-working USB output issue (which may not matter to many) is the only reason why I did not give these 5 stars.",[],B004LU9HEA,B004LU9HEA,AHKGIXB5KR72QOZ7CCIWXARLX7GQ,1331828016000,11,True,2012-03-15 16:13:36.000

I bought a Biterun headset and it works great with this speaker.  However, I have only had it 4 months and am very careful with it and the Mic jack broke off inside the unit.

4.0,Unique instrument and native tuning.,"This instrument has a very particular native tuning.<br />To those looking for a diversified instrument that can play many styles, the Lyre harp will only provide that with a custom tuning, which requires more prior music experience than a beginner would have.<br /><br />On the topic of build and sound, the build is OK.<br />There are multiple faults in the design that make maintenance more difficult than one could argue it needs to be.<br />For example:<br />Two of the strings had to be replaced.<br />Both broke while tensioning to the required pitch.<br />One was on the high end, one was on the low end.<br /><br />It seems this kit uses three different sized strings. All of the high pitch strings seem to use the same gauge steel strings. The lower end has two variations, and some seemed to be in the wrong places from the factory. (Thicker gauge on higher notes, lighter gauge on lower notes).<br /><br />The mechanism for screw tensioning is as simple as it gets. They are threaded poles into the wood, and because of this, you need to know exactly how long your string needs to be and how many turns you need to tension it before you install a new string. Otherwise, it will result in higher or lower string height. The strings were all flat from the factory, but this is something to be wary of as a consumer, as it may take you a couple tries and couple of wasted strings to get it correct.<br /><br />The sound of the instrument is not exceptional, but not completely dissonant either. The build isn‚Äôt noticeably braced with more than simple wood adhered to wood, but for the price as a whole kit it is acceptable.<br /><br />If it had been a little higher in price bracket and there could be better tuner pegs, better QC and slightly more intricate build, this could be a fantastic instrument. However, with that said, this may still be competitive in this price bracket, and if you are looking for an entry level Lyre Harp and know what you‚Äôre getting into, then this is a great choice!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-20h5YcTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-20h5YcTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-20h5YcTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B2JLP2F8,B0B2JLM1RP,AHUBBPE2Y7IV53VLYU6H3ORHJNWQ,1667074811836,1,False,2022-10-29 20:20:11.836

3.0,Lots of strings for very little money - and it shows,"I got six packs of strings for less than the normal price of a simple pack of cheap strings.  Score.  I figured they'd be pretty cheap, so I wasn't expecting too much.  After all, these are going on a little pink 3/4 scale guitar we picked out of our neighbors trash while taking a walk around the block.  I'm glad the guitar is a smaller scale because these strings *just barely* fit.  If this was full scale, or even the same 3/4 scale, but pinned bridge instead of pull through, I probably wouldnt have been able to get the D or G strings to catch on the tuners.  My last gripe is that I couldn't make out the difference between the two high B and E strings.  I grabbed a precision micrometer from my garage, and sure enough, both strings were exactly .29 mm.  Sure this must be a mistake, I thought, but sure enough, the other five packs are the same.  Weird, but hey, this trash guitar has bigger playbility issues than a tension imbalance in the two high strings.<br /><br />So ultimately, yeah, its a lot of strings for a couple bucks - as long as they fit your guitar, and you dont mind running .012 for both the B and high E.  So I guess I got what I paid for...<br /><br />But really, if youre stringing up six novelty or kids guitars, these strings will certainly do.",[],B08X5ZNJ25,B08X5ZNJ25,AHPEFNW3EXTCLAVZD2IGQQESJOTA,1642540062722,0,True,2022-01-18 21:07:42.722

With its metal frame, it is quite sturdy and durable. The only problem is, it won‚Äôt fit my mic, a Blueberry. I have a small cheap computer condenser mic that fits in this mount, but I wouldn‚Äôt use that microphone for recording, at least, not for recording music. So definitely, if you‚Äôre considering this mount, measure the diameter of your mic first. If your mic is much bigger than 1.75‚Äù in diameter, you‚Äôll need a bigger shock mount. Overall, this mount is quite sturdy and well made, but it will only accommodate very small microphones.",[],B07Q8JV68F,B07Q8JV68F,AGWG4ARSJHOVM22SZOA2NDT6GDGQ_1,1601307083119,0,False,2020-09-28 15:31:23.119
5.0,Great beginner guitar,"I received the guitar a day earlier than expected and it surprisingly came in perfect condition. Taking it out of the box I was for sure thinking that the guitar was going to be banged up because the only protection it had was only the soft case that came with it.

I say this because I've been learning on an electric guitar this whole time and it's totally different. :)",[],B077C2PZXV,B07FB6TYS7,AGZJN2Y2HB6XPDNP6TS7INBGDVKQ,1587497785101,0,True,2020-04-21 19:36:25.101

3.0,PRO'S AND CONS,"So, the microphone itself is absolutely fine for a beginner. It has clear audio for recording podcasts, vocals, etc. BUT in order to achieve this quality of sound there a few things that you will need.<br /><br />When you plug the soundcard into a laptop, there is a very loud buzzing sound that interferes with the microphone.I had to play around with the sound settings in my laptops control panel to reduce the buzzing sound and then boost the audio coming from the 'USB device' and not from 'microphone properties' itself. Any additional noise i was able to edit out using a software. I will say though to invest in a good quality soundcard or an audio interface (best option). A soundcard would not be necessary if you use a desktop with a built in soundcard and this improves the audio quality massively. But the audio interface would still make a huge difference in the quality of the audio.<br /><br />Secondly, the components in this set on its own is not enough to produce an audible sound. You need a 48V phantom power box to give the microphone the power it needs to operate well. ANY MICROPHONE YOU BUY NEEDS A POWER SOURCE. If you have an audio interface, you will not need a power box because it is built into the interface. But if you're using a soundcard or a desktop with a built in soundcard, the power box makes a hell of a difference.<br /><br />Thirdly, the microphone works best on a desktop in my opinion. There's just clearer audio than with a laptop.<br />Please adjust the sound settings in your laptop/desktop or you will get a significant amount of noise in your audio. I had to reduce the audio boost as well as volume in order to get rid of any interferences.<br /><br />Overall its good for beginners, especially if you cannot afford a higher quality microphone as yet.",[],B07MXCM5XY,B075GQ4YP5,AFNXHPECSIZCZKTOSD4GEYWIXB7A,1605499585264,0,True,2020-11-16 04:06:25.264

4.0,Good sound for the money - looks great,"I've had mine for over a year a now. It still sounds the same. Pretty good,  but not the greatest when in reverb & distortion, but still very good at this entry level. The pups are just a little muddy. The clean tones are much nicer. (bright even) It has very good sustain. Almost as good as a string-through. Fenders, B.C. Rich, Dean, (whatever) are all the same at this price level. And that's just my opinion. I just liked the look & the price. I never tried the tremelo, but it did come with the whammy-bar. The guitar itself, still looks very nice. It has NO protective finish at all, ( no varnish, lacquer or clear coat... just bare wood) so I added some &#34;Liquid Gold&#34;  floor restorer when I first got it to make sure it wouldn't dry out, crack, or warp. That may sound odd, but the body soaked it up thirstily w/no changes to the color, sheen, or tone in any way. I've been a high-end wood worker for many years. It's not only safe, but a good idea to condition it. Again, that's an opinion I have. The polka-dots are just some thin sticky back plastic dots I had sitting in a drawer - they'll come right off when I'm ready to go back. I just wanted a change for a while. I was inspired by Rhoads' guitar from Blizzard of OZZ. I just couldn't see 5  stars in my mind. But I've been very happy w/ it so far. Oh' yeah, I did have to tighten up the cable jack one time when I first got it. Everything else was set-up right, even the pups height. I truly hope this review was helpful.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cwOKW3jzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cwOKW3jzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cwOKW3jzL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818b7Z3ItXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818b7Z3ItXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818b7Z3ItXL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aRWSfg0OL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aRWSfg0OL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aRWSfg0OL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lOKRGGNTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lOKRGGNTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lOKRGGNTL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xvKoUXeaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xvKoUXeaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xvKoUXeaL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01MY9QSAW,B01MY9QSAW,AFR7NZ6M6ASXDVV6CIAQBKHOHREQ,1540093813069,2,False,2018-10-21 03:50:13.069

5.0,Beautiful guitar for the price,"I‚Äôm a keyboardist who can play 7 and a ¬Ω chords on guitar. I recently made a few upgrades to my home studio, namely buying a Wasp analog synth module and a small mixing board. I also picked up a couple of effects pedals. I do have a nylon string guitar, but I wanted an electric guitar so I could play it through the synth and the effects. I searched for over a week to find a ‚Äú$50 used guitar‚Äù but no luck there. Then I thought even if I did find one it might work fine, or might have a fret that buzzes or some other problem. Then I started searching for electrics in the $75 to $100 range. The problem there is about a dozen companies make cheap guitars that all look the same ‚Äì cheap copies of a copy of a copy of a Strat. And then I saw it. The Leo Jamyz green guitar and immediately bought one. It‚Äôs so green that there can be no more green. The one I bought for $98 is even nicer than the one in the product pics. Mine has a double cutaway, a pick guard, volume and tone controls for each pickup instead of just one set for both and beautiful seashells inlays on the fret board. If you look closely they appear synthetic, but that doesn‚Äôt make a difference to me.

If your looking into streaming or need a higher quality microphone for work this is the new entry level. This also has options to go into a cardioid or omnidirectional pickup which is nice. Only drawback is gain is handled in windows but hey that's about standard at this price range.<br /><br />The main thing that has set this apart from competition is sheer reliability. No dropped audio very minimal buzz from electrical interference as well. Keep in mind this can depend on your motherboard and whats going on with your USB ports but the last USB microphone that has impressed me this much was the HYPERX Quadcast. While this isn't quite on par with that microphone it gets pretty close at less than half the price.<br /><br />I'm just gonna say it now, For value and convenience I would just get this microphone if you need higher quality or a bassier radio/studio quality sound start looking into an XLR setup.",[],B0B1DB1T5F,B0BGGRQCD2,AG52HOHNI3P6SSLEBIYPMI3T6A5Q,1673892681077,0,False,2023-01-16 18:11:21.077

1.0,Gretsch and Fender  Trash boxes,This guitar is made in Indonesia and is stamped as such on the head stock. It is not an acoustic guitar since the cavity is not large enough to do any thing tone wise. Computers control the specs and the  new stains and lacquers give it a nice look. The guts are what makes the difference and this guitar is trash with Chinese parts. This Guitar is worth $189.95 retail and not a nickel more. It sounds like a cheap B.C. Rich with mashy clarity. Most stores won't even carry it in stock and its only available when Sanpans deliver every two months in a hidden cove. Fender has really hit rock bottom doing this.

The braided cording is GORGEOUS. Just really classy and durable. This may sound funny, but it is high praise:  it reminds me of some of the more expensive phone charge cords that I have purchased that have lasted me longer and were well worth the cost.

3.0,Subpar quality guitar,"Let me start off by saying I am not a guitar expert.  In fact, I don't know how to play one at all.  I have no experience with other brands.  My musical ability was playing trumpet for about 7 years in school. That said, for the price I really expected a little more quality out of this.  Everything about it feels very cheap.  I know you can pay several hundred, or even thousands for a very nice guitar, and I didn't expect that from this at all.  I wonder what the guitars that are selling for half this ones price are like, because I really can't imagine one of less quality than this.<br /><br />The finish leaves a lot to be desired.  I couldn't tell if it was just dust or a poor finish on the outside of the guitar.  Either way, it shouldn't arrive looking like that. The tuning heads also seem extremely cheap.  They feel like plastic and I expected those to at least be metal.  I tried to tune this by ear but just couldn't get it to sound right.  I know there's an included electric tuner, as well as all kinds of parts, and even spare strings.  Yet I honestly lost my interest in this guitar within 10 minutes of playing with it.<br /><br />My intention with this guitar was to dabble around on it and maybe learn a few tunes.  I honestly just wanted to see if I enjoyed playing one.  I have zero intentions of looking at anything more expensive. If you are in the same boat I am I would suggest saving yourself the headache and just buy an even cheaper guitar.  I can't imagine you'll be any worse off.  At least you'll know if you are going to like it without forking out more than is necessary.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EkRQ6iZKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EkRQ6iZKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EkRQ6iZKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71T5xWUCLBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71T5xWUCLBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71T5xWUCLBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wsl+6KoXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wsl+6KoXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wsl+6KoXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81P0wiMGcQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81P0wiMGcQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81P0wiMGcQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09LHDX9QM,B09LHDX9QM,AHRNF5L4L5XWXWLO5QDE2RQVHBDA,1651360037337,2,False,2022-04-30 23:07:17.337

3.0,"Useless manual, poor support, NOT for beginners","How Donner can advertise this as for beginners, I have no idea, because the absolutely useless user manual and obscure hoops you have to jump through to secure a copy of Donner's editor are ridiculous. Any beginner who buys this will have a LOT of work ahead of them, not to mention a learning curve if you've never set one up before.<br /><br />The product listing mentions the editor multiple times, but the manual says nothing about it and it's nowhere to be found on Donner's website. Another reviewer reported having to cast an arcane series of spells to get it. I still haven't been able to secure one.

Nah. The manual is useless. Just a few pages for each language and all it does is give brief, vague descriptions of each button. It gives you no real idea of how to use it, what the functions are, etc. If you've never used a MIDI pad before you will be 100% lost.<br /><br />On the plus side, it feels well made, the action on the pads is good, it's got a few programmable pads and faders, and it's VERY portable. You can easily take this to gigs, jam sessions, on a vacation, or whatever else. As a physical product, it's well made and feels good to interact with.

1.0,There's A Better Way,"Having a pile of aging cassette mix tapes to archive to .mp3s, I bought the Plusdeck to do the job.  It failed in every possible way.<br /><br />Hampered by a badly written manual, with indecipherable instructions like ""According to computer manufacturers, the way how to open case and make certain 5.25 bay is different,"" installing the PlusDeck hardware took an hour.  The software was worse: the CD doesn't run (except by a Windows Explore workaround), which doesn't matter anyway: the 3.25c and 3.23, as well as the 3.22 and 3.21 versions of the Plusdeck software record worthless sound files garbled with data artifacts and hissing with static.  Bypassing the malfunctioning Plusdeck software by using Audacity instead, I was able to at last make clean .mp3 records off the Plusdeck--only for a while.  In its second week of operation, on the ninth cassette, the Plusdeck began SHREDDING TAPES.  After pulling out several yards of precious music the Plusdeck had mangled, I opened my computer, removed the Plusdeck, and threw it in the trash.<br /><br />Avoid these horrors by using a Y cable and Audacity instead. A Y cable connects the stereo output of your stereo's tape deck or amplifier to the 3.5-mm line-in input of your computer's sound card.  Audacity (downloadable for free) is a compact, powerful and free open-source software application that comes with a very well written help guide (compare that to Plusdeck's atrocious manual) that does for sound files what Photoshop does for image files.  Audacity has all the controls you want, including line-in volume, recording in stereo, and even an ""amplify"" algorithm for reliably increasing the range of your sound files without clipping, and a [[ASIN:B000067RBT Belkin Y Audio Cable (12 feet)]] costs less than five dollars.<br /><br />Unless you enjoy wasted hours, garbled recordings, and ruined tapes, I suggest you avoid the Plusdeck in any of its unreliable present and future incarnations.",[],B000CSGIJW,B000CSGIJW,AHSDLO5CMUTMS3MSH367UBDSABGA,1189356107000,142,False,2007-09-09 16:41:47.000

5.0,A Great Multipurpose Speaker,"[[VIDEOID:be2cbd96d128a9564225e7999db80d62]] This is a serious high-powered wireless karaoke portable Bluetooth speaker with 12‚Äù subwoofer and 800-watt power. There are many ways to play music besides using Bluetooth including FM radio, USB flash drive, SD card reader so can be used as an MP3 player, 3.5mm AUX input, and a ¬º‚Äù mic/guitar input. When using the radio scan, it will scan all stations and put numbers to them so you do not have to go through all the empty stations every time you turn on the radio. If you know the number of the station you can use the remote to go to that station number and you can search by music genres. It comes with fun DJ lights, a microphone, a rechargeable battery, 3.2‚Äô feet speaker stand, rolling wheels, and extended handle so can take it anywhere.<br />I was very overly surprised by this speaker/karaoke machine. There are so many options to choose from where to listen to music, lights on or off, change base, use the mic or not, etc. We were even able to add additional lights using the USB connection. The Bluetooth was a little hard to get set up but after that, it works great from changing it to Bluetooth to the radio, etc. then back. I do wish the microphone was wireless but if you do not need it you can unplug it and put it away which is nice. I really like the stand. You can set it and then tighten it down where you want. We were able to take it to the beach without worrying about the speaker getting sandy. My only problem with it is that the pinhole does not lock into place in the holder it just holds it so when rolling it, it falls out easily. I attached a picture of it.<br />The minute it was set up my family had to have a dance/pizza party. Plus, we already have taken it to the beach as I said.

5.0,A DMX controllable motorized light at this price? Wow!,"[[VIDEOID:7eb57f592f6b3cbdc7cc230a27c0a2dd]] As my band gets more sophisticated and gets better gigs, we are adding light shows to our performance. I bought a simple Moukey LED PAR light a while back and was amazed to see it could be controlled by a computer using DMX. So I took a chance on this item. It is a fully motorized and programmable light (I used freestyler which is free software, and cheap USB to DMX cable that I got on Amazon). You get RGB and white and flashing effects in addition to the smooth motorized motion.  If you don't want to deal with DMX and software, the lamp can be set to several automatic modes where it will move around and alternate colors and patterns automatically (you can even limit which color set to use for finer control). It even has two ""sound activated"" modes where it will change according to the beat of the music. This works best when the music is quite loud. The light comes with a metal bracket so that it can be suspended from a truss system above the stage, or you can sit in the floor, maybe in front of the drum set, or on top of the bass of guitar amplifier, I discovered that this makes the sounds activated feature work quite well.<br />The light has a built in fan to cool it off, and it is a little loud that you *might* hear it if you play soft acoustic music, but you won't hear it with any amplified music.<br />This is a tremendous value to get started with lighting effects without breaking the bank.<br /><br />It is quite difficult to take a good video if the light in action. I tried to get footage from one of our live gigs but it came out terrible, so I'm attaching a quick demo from the light in my music room (bonus points if you recognize it from my previous LED light review!). The cable with the round metal end is the DMX cable used for computer control.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dz7hG9Q+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dz7hG9Q+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dz7hG9Q+L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wu6JK8lHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wu6JK8lHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wu6JK8lHL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zG-ZZhmmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zG-ZZhmmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zG-ZZhmmL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LWfKdqEbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LWfKdqEbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LWfKdqEbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07XJ1Y4BM,B07XJ1Y4BM,AFC4BKWMMDNLNJM74EN3EDDVHA5Q,1574147792043,1,True,2019-11-19 07:16:32.043

4.0,"Cymbal with unique sound and volume characterists, a work of art!","This is one of those cymbals you're better off hand selecting because cymbal will vary slightly with the sound and markings from the sandblasting technique used on it.  Unfortunately, lots of drum shops don't carry meinl, yet, let alone various cymbals from different series'.  With that in mind, I actually don't think this cymbal is TOO versatile, but it's not for just one style either.  The sandblasted finish gives it a little bit of a quieter, washier sound than a &#34;traditional&#34; cymbal, hence why these cymbals are more flexible and can literally bend.  Despite the washiness this ride still has great stick definition and the bell realllly cuts through.<br /><br />People say this is a cymbal for fusion and jazz, but you can totally use it for other types of music, in my opinion (execept maybe metal).  The key is to make sure it blends in with the rest of your cymbals which, depending on the rest of your setup can be an issue because of this cymbals unique sound characterists and different volume levels.  If your whole cymbal setup is the sand series this cymbal will really shine, but if you are combining it with some mb20 crashes or perhaps even a custom projection crashes things could begin to sound a little messy. Keep in mind that you won't have these issues if you are just using this cymbal for recording purposes since you can adjust the levels in a studio.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I think this is an AMAZING cymbal and an example of what kind of things we'll be seeing in the future with cymbals.",[],B002P8N67O,B088N76T19,AFJWXUS5W5P2JGU46SQ2XGCUKBWA,1418192709000,0,False,2014-12-10 06:25:09.000

If I tuned the E to the next octave higher where it's supposed to be, the tension was insane and the string snapped. After tuning the E and it snapped, I tried the A, and that snapped as well as the D string. I didn't even bother with G. I love D'Addario electric strings and standard acoustic strings, but I'll probably never waste my money on another 12 string set.

So if you have some decent pedals, this amp is awesome, but do not expect the overdrive channels to sound good on their own. Think of this as a much more portable roland jc140.

It records amazing sound, is small and convenient to clip on, and has exceptional battery. However, today at some point while using the device the battery door retainer broke. There's a small piece that moves to lock/unlock the battery compartment which is attached by a little plastic piece. The piece that clips in and holds the door shut has broken off completely, so there is no way to hold the compartment shut. I've tried tape which seemed to hold, but due to the strength of the springs it came off during use. I could power this via USB, but now I'd have to have a battery pack strapped to me as well which is just not worth it.<br /><br />I've tried searching for a replacement part, but could not find anything. I've seen quite a few people having this same issue, and it's a real shame because you'd think if it's so common you could at least replace the part. I just ordered a new one a few days ago to gift to a friend for Christmas, but now I'm debating returning it and finding something that will hold up to being worn on your belt. It's sad because I love this device, but can't justify the massive price to risk having it break so easily.",[],B0797DCMGM,B08T2N2D6C,AHOG3HF2XZPDOFEDKHYMVIIS7DPA,1608593419101,1,True,2020-12-21 23:30:19.101

It was wrapped in foam, and in perfect condition. Now for the Uke, first let me say why I chose this one from all the others, simple, It has a solid mahogany top! The back is mahogany ply, I can't say about the sides as you cant see the edges  It is very well crafted and even has laser carving around the sound hole, as well as the name on the headstock.It is beautiful! This is my first Uke, but I have many quality guitars, and am so happy to add this to my collection. Now as for its playability, its awesome! and the sound is as well. The tuner is wonderful, and you will have to tune it each time you play, but just slightly, and if you watch videos, the pros do that as well. I do recommend this, and might buy the other two sizes as well!

5.0,Great mic at the pricepoint.,"The first thing that struck me when first opening up the Audio-Technica AT2035 is the build quality. It feels simultaneously sturdy and compact, compared to the Blue Yetis that I've used before it, and would call them the main competition in the pricepoint and for the use-cases you would use these sorts of mics for.<br /><br />The sound quality is just as good as a similar Yeti mic, but I would argue that the mic's physical design is better than any of Yeti's pill-like designs, and its also much smaller and lighter, which means whatever sort of arm or stand you're hooking it up to will have less of an issue holding it.  Because it has a metal frame wrapped around its grating, if you drop it, it will likely protect the metal filter from denting.  I would just call its build a more concise bit of technology versus something like a Yeti which just seems to be built like it's built for a more iconic look, rather than being built to be sturdy and easy to use in a recording or streaming situation.  I got the kit with the shock mount, which I recommend if you can find it in a bundle, this mic was built for it with its perfectly cylindrical housing.<br /><br />Great product for the 120-150 price range, XLR is an improvement in both quality and sturdiness over a USB mic, making the AT2035 the perfect upgrade mic for someone who is looking to upgrade from their headset to something more serious without breaking the bank.",[],B002T45X1G,B07JNKY9T8,AE2ON4S4V32KTJRFAI6CC3LHUASA,1660701407472,5,True,2022-08-17 01:56:47.472

5.0,Awesome guitar.,"First of all people complaining about the bridge, the hardware etc, you should have gone to a store and give it a play before buying. This IS NOT A STRAT or an lousy Ibanez, the fret is rather thick which can lead to some problems playing. The guitar right out the store will ALWAYS be out of tune and it will be harder to get in tune if you let the time pass by, you need to check for any fretboard flaws like being a little bend, the bridge will need certain calibration also.<br /><br />After I bought this guitar the P90 mic was sounding a little bit off, after reviewing the guitar I noticed there was a lousy cable work inside, after fixing it seems like a whole new guitar.<br /><br />Recommendations: if you are looking for a really comfy guitar go for a strat, you can never go wrong with a strat but you will be missing out the great tone and versatility that having a humbucker and a P90 in the same guitar, the body gives it a sweet lasting sound and maybe if this will be your first Jazzmaster you will probably want a lot more of these, as always you receive what you pay for, you cant expect a 449$ guitar to perform like a 1000$ although it's not imposible.<br /><br />Remember: go to a store play it, buy it and do a nice calibration on the bridge and check for bent fretboards.",[],B003YU8NXE,B003YU8NXE,AEGFZH45LNTWGYHW4VLTQTEWJWYQ,1374864797000,0,False,2013-07-26 18:53:17.000

1.0,This AI is what's wrong with the world,"This product represents a big chunk of what's wrong with the world. I'm talking about the UM2.<br /><br />1. It doesn't even do anything special that a $5 adapter into the back of your PC can't do.  It's only one channel, split into L/R, so good luck making that work properly with however you plan on using it. The name sure is misleading.  Shoulda called it the UM1.<br /><br />2. There are no 1st-party drivers.  In a move that is so capitalistic it hurts, they just lean on open-source drivers that may or may not work.  Who cares right?  They got your money. I was never able to get ASIO4ALL to work.  It shows that nothing is plugged in unless I plug in the mic on the left/XLR input, and even then it still doesn't detect the guitar input.<br /><br />3. There's latency.  From what I can tell, it's as significant as just plugging directly into the back of my PC.  If you want to use this for multi-track recording, that's probably not going to work out for you. Who buys an AI that has a ton of latency?  Isn't that the whole point of an AI?  That they process the single on the device so they can get it to the DAW faster?<br /><br />4. The Behringer website cherry-picks 4/5 star reviews from Sweetwater and Amazon, so if you're shopping around trying to make a decision, beware that they are purposely misleading you about the satisfaction of their customers. Who does that?  More importantly, WHY do they do that? And how is that legal?<br /><br />I was never able to get the guitar input to work, and the mic input always had significant delay.

Keep a pile of Jazz IIIs in the concave pocket (shallow depression for holding stuff). I don't own any very expensive guitars, so I'm not concerned about resting their bodies on my carpet. The guitar rest simply makes your guitar more accessible, and that means... you're more apt to grab your axe and play more.<br /><br />When un-weighted by the guitar neck, the Rest itself is rather light and can move around easily. No big deal at all.<br /><br />*****************************<br />EDIT: Just purchased another one -- an axe close at hand is an axe you will play. That's been my experience. After living with this for a few days one thing has become an annoyance: when there's no guitar holding it to the table, it's very easy to knock it off the desk. The way it is designed is such that the leverage has a see-saw effect that will have it fly a few feet across the room. Because it sticks out horizontally, just a nudge with a knee and there it goes. So if you have picks or anything sitting in the round holder area, it can be an annoyance.<br /><br />I do use these for my guitars, but I feel much more comfortable using a proper stand.

If you sellect the 10 watt option and then crank everything on the amp it will sound GREAT for one or two practices before it blows up. Okay maybe not literally but it will definately ruin your day.<br /><br />  If you can afford this amp get it. It will be your go to amp for a very long time.

5.0,Great amplifier for the price and for what it's got!,"Got this amp about a month ago, and although I haven't got all the time I wished to try it, I can say I'm very satisfied with it. I'll try to be specific here, about myself and the product.<br /><br />Me: Not a professional player, just wanted something I could use to restart practicing, and for my kid as he's starting to like guitars.<br /><br />What I Wanted?: Something that could give some effects for the guitar, that I could use with headphones, and that I could play some mp3 and backing tracks to practice along (meaning, cd/mp3 in). At first my options were the Pocket Pod, Pocket Pod Express or Behringer V-amp 3 (they all have what I wanted and thought I'd be more than happy with them).<br />But, some day, surfing the web, I found this kind of amps , with digital effects included, and headphones and Aux in... Didn't know they existed (believe or not!), so I got interested and started to investigate options, brands, what to look for, reviews and comments... Well, I thought that they got what I needed, plus the option to hear the guitar directly (I mean, as a guitar should be heard, through an amp); with the Pocket Pods and the V-amp I can only hear the guitar directly by hooking them to a sound system or a set of speakers, wich at first was OK for me, but when I knew about these amps, I decided I'd rather prefer the direct option. So I searched models that were withing my budget range: Peavey (Vypyr 15), Line 6 (Spider IV 15), Roland (Don't remember the model, and price was higher) and Fender (Mustang I), and after comparing them and evaluating pros and cons and prices, I decided for the Fender Mustang I.<br /><br />They all have a bunch of amps and effects, and you can adjust them to your liking, so I won't state that as ""Positive"" things, as they are assumed so; I will focus on some extras that not all the models I was considering have available. I read comments regarding how some of them sound more or less ""digitalized"" than others, or that they don't sound as good as the real ""analog"" ones, but hey, aren't we talking about ""digital amps and effects"" here? Perhaps some of them DO sound digitalized, but that's a very, very small price to pay for having eight amplifiers in one package (I can't have/afford eight real amplifier models and a bunch of pedals).<br /><br />So, for me:<br /><br />Positives:<br />* You can use a footswitch for changing presets (only two of them, but better than none).<br />* USB connection to the PC, where you can expand the presets settings with Fender's Fuse, and have the posibility to download and play a lot more from Fender's Fuse site (some Fender original and some from community users).<br /><br />Negatives:<br />* Switching between presets as you play isn't practical, as you will need three arms for doing that while you're playing (this applies to this kind of amps, regardless of brand). But with Mustang I you have the choice to use a footswitch (it's on my wish list for now).<br />* Perhaps not very intuitive on some functions, but a good reading of the manual, and tweaking with the knobs and buttons will get you there.<br /><br />Important note: Remember that I'm only considering Peavey's Vypyr 15 and Line 6's Spider IV 15 for this comparison with Fender's Mustang I; their higher models have other features wich include footswitch and so on, but as they weren't in my price range, I didn't considered them. For those of you who can afford one of those higher models, these considerations do not necessarily apply.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />For the price, I'm more than satisified with what I got. Plenty of amps and effects, headphones in, mp3 in, footswitch in, direct sound (though I use it with headphones almost every time, since is at night when I got time to practice and I don't want to disturb wife and kid and neighbours) and USB to PC. Software for editing and downloading presets, and for recording to the PC. For being a small ""bedroom"" amplifier, it sounds very good and loud. When I tried it without the phones, I was making a lot of sound with the volume at 3. I think it's clear that it's not a gig amplifier, but then again, for the price and for being a small amplifier, it does REALLY good what it is intended for.<br /><br />I know that this kind of amps have their limitations; I KNEW it when I decided to buy it. I wasn't expecting to get more than what a practice amplifier can give, and this is a practice amplifier, with some very nice features. It offers what I want and need. If I were a professional musician, and/or need equipment to play live and so on, this won't be my choice, simply because it won't fit the bill. If you're just a home player (like me), and want to jam along with your favorite songs, then you can't go wrong with this Mustang I (I even extend this recommendation to the other models I listed above if you don't care for the footswitch and/or USB connection, as they offer amps and effects as well, it will only be a matter of taste, of which you liked most).<br /><br />Hope this review help others make their decision, wichever it may be.<br /><br />Best regards!",[],B0042EZH6W,B0042EZH6W,AGO4OIHI3O3HUFIRP3TAW4UDHPKA,1302720956000,1,True,2011-04-13 18:55:56.000

5.0,Compact but nice guitar stand. Fits a Les Paul in its case.,"I had put off assembling this stand because I was rearranging some of my gear and was afraid it would dominate too much space. When I finally got around to setting it up today, I was pleased that it was big enough but compact.<br /><br />Assembly was not complex or difficult. As usual, since it is a real wood product using wood screws, I followed the directions, but I assembled the whole product with the screws in but not tight. Only once all the pieces were in place did I tighten everything down bit-by-bit in a zig zag order to make sure the alignment all stayed true. Whether or not this is necessary for this stand, the result was a stand that was not crooked or askew.<br /><br />While I am not sure if it is walnut, it appears to be a nice finer grained hardwood as opposed to a cheap poplar or pine, based upon the grain I can see in the bored holes for the screws. There is felt lining on all the parts that make contact with the guitars, so it is unlikely to scratch your finish, unless you toss your guitar violently on the stand.<br /><br />The pegs are easily popped in and out to change where the guitars slot in, which allows ensuring the right depth for thicker dreadnoughts. I noted that since the pegs are based on basic dowel pegs, some of the pre-existing holes are tighter than others, so I moved the pegs around based on thickness to get as many of them tight as possible.<br /><br />What really made me particularly pleased was that despite being a compact stand, it can handle a Gibson Les Paul in its case (see pic). If you take out two pegs (four peg spread), the resulting gap is actually the perfect width and very snug on the case. With the weight of the unchambered Les Paul, I am pretty sure the stand is not going to flop over or go anywhere. It is a great space saving way to store my guitar!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7185LjgAOHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7185LjgAOHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7185LjgAOHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BUoeJ3yvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BUoeJ3yvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BUoeJ3yvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iGiRxwh-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iGiRxwh-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iGiRxwh-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B6WW6HZ4,B0B6WW6HZ4,AGE2YIJLISBKCAYKDOEOIBJ3I43Q,1669442829979,0,False,2022-11-26 06:07:09.979

Therefore you can run this off of pretty much any mixer you want because it doesn't require power. However, this mic is also one of the quietest on the market. You'll need to pair this with something like a Cloudlifter CL-1 or a good clean Pre-Amp because it needs a lot of clean gain to give adequate volume levels. My SM7b runs into an ART Tube MP Project Series tube preamp and out to a channel strip before ever hitting my mixer and it sounds wonderful.<br />I highly recommend checking these mics out at a local music store if you can before purchasing since everyone's voice sounds different on every microphone.

It records, transposes, and best of all you can charge it and use it on a desk or coffee table without plugging it in.  It has 16 volume levels, all numbered, and the loudest volume is about 90 decibels.  It is great to take to grandparents house if they have no piano to show off your skills.  It came extremely well packed, heavy cardboard box and foam all around it. The touch is easy, you cannot control expression as on an acoustic piano, the tone is decent for the price.

I purchased this for myself and did was not provided this item for free.<br /><br />How I Tested it:<br />I put the Samson Q2U to the test in a variety of tasks, including podcasting, streaming, and recording music. I also tested it in different settings, such as a quiet home office and a noisy coffee shop. This allowed me to get a good sense of how the microphone performs in different environments and how well it adapts to different types of audio production.<br /><br />What I liked about the product:<br />The first thing that stood out to me about the Samson Q2U was the quality of the microphone itself. The audio it produces is fantastic, with clear and crisp sound that is perfect for broadcasting and recording. I was also pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to set up. The microphone comes with a USB cable, so all I had to do was plug it into my computer and I was ready to go. The boom arm that comes with the microphone is also a great addition. The arm is of great build quality and it can rotate out of the way when not in use. It also has a variety of height and position options, making it versatile for any style of recording. The flexible install options makes it perfect for any content creator or podcaster looking to elevate their audio game.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the product:<br />The only downside I found with the microphone is that it would have been helpful to have a wire channel control for the microphone. The wire hangs off the arm and needs to be secured. This is a small inconvenience and can be easily fixed with a piece of tape or a cable tie.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Overall, I highly recommend the Samson Q2U. The microphone and boom arm combination is perfect for anyone looking to elevate their audio game. The sound quality is top-notch, the build quality is excellent, and the boom arm is versatile and easy to use. The Samson Q2U is a great investment for any content creator or podcaster.<br /><br />Would I recommend it:<br />I would definitely recommend the Samson Q2U to anyone looking for a quality microphone and boom arm combination. It is perfect for content creators, podcasters, and anyone looking to improve their audio quality. The sound quality is clear and crisp and the boom arm is versatile and easy to use, making this a great option for anyone looking to improve their audio game.<br /><br />My final opinion:<br />The Samson Q2U is an excellent microphone and boom arm combination that is perfect for anyone looking to elevate their audio game. The sound quality is top-notch, the build quality is excellent, and the boom arm is versatile and easy to use. The only downside is the lack of wire channel control, but it's a small inconvenience that can be easily fixed.

5.0,I used pretty much all the components aside from the tuners to ...,"[[VIDEOID:e30609de0794520c5fa7c31255b24e36]] Well, this is the first product I ever felt the need to review.  I used pretty much all the components aside from the tuners to rebuild a MIM Stratocaster that had some issues.  I was very, very, very skeptical due to the price, but I wasn't looking to put any real money into this rebuild as my primary guitars are a American Standard Telecaster and Les Paul.  This rebuild was more of an experiment to see if I could make my 20 year old MIM Strat worthy of playing again.  I figured if the components were shoddy or if the pickups sounded horrible, I wasn't really out any money.<br /><br />Let me say this, I can not tell a difference between the pickups that I took out and what came in this set.  I did read a review about some noise issue from other reviewers so I bought a $5 roll of copper tape and shielded the cavities before I replaced with this integrated pick guard.  There is very little noise when on the neck pickup, but it is slight, no more noise than my Tele or Les Paul.  The tone of the pickups every bit as pure as the originals.  So anyone who has reservations about the pickup quality should not.  That is not to say that I would use this pick guard on a $2000 Stratocaster, but if you have an old Mexican, Korean, Japanese, Squire or Strat Knockoff - this set will serve you well.<br /><br />I also replaced the tremolo bridge with what came in this package and the quality of the bridge is every bit as good, if not better, than the original Fender component I removed.  Additionally, I used the chrome neck plate and plastic back plate.<br /><br />The only remark I will make is that yes indeed, only around 1/2 of the holes lined up on the pick guard and only 2 holes lined up on the back plate, but this is minor.  If you have a drill you can make a few new pilot holes, and even if you don't have a drill, the self tapping screws that come with the set will work just fine.  Didn't mind having to pilot a few holes because the pick guard covers all the old holes anyway - you will never notice!<br /><br />Great product and nothing can come close to touching the price.",[],B009GB5KAY,B009GB5KAY,AF6DKZLMET3W4DPMAFDT7Z6BI7EA,1462364324000,8,True,2016-05-04 12:18:44.000

5.0,Everything a DJ has to have.,"Background:<br />Club & Rave DJ since 2002 - previous setup: Technic MKIIs + Numark 3001X + Serato. 7 year break from last time I owned a setup.<br /><br />Serato vs Rekordbox:<br />This feels like a non issue. I cut my teeth on on Serato somewhere around 1.2 (Current is somewhere around 2.0). I also recently purchased the DDR-SB3, but found I needed more. While Serato has come a long way, even with DJ Lite that came with the SB3, Rekordbox feels like it's step in step - I have not noticed any differences that would have made me regret the switch. What you may not know is Rekordbox can set you up to be plug & play with the club standard CDJs. The cosmetics of Rekordbox could be the only applicable difference and as I've been streaming 5 days a week for the last 6 weeks, there hasn't been one single jump in my relearning curve that I've had to make. They feel _very_ close to each other.<br /><br />DDJ-800 vs DDJ-xxx<br />The biggest difference I have noticed between jumping from the $200 tier to $800 is honestly the size of the pitch/tempo fader. The tempo fader on the DDJ-SB3 is extremely short @ about 1/3 the length on the DDJ-800, and depending on your genre, that can make a difference. For me, it just wasn't enough wiggle room, and the sensitivity was way too high on that short of a track. While I could spin a set on the SB3 - I have better ability to successfully match quickly with a more customizable fader, which this one has. The 3 modes it has also adds to that wonderfully.<br /><br />I have not yet jumped into all of the pad's or sampler, but all of the effects, faders, & pots all are very smooth and high quality. I'm used to a kill switch, on the EQs, and while these don't kill completely, they do effectively handle the EQ work that needs to be done, to construct your sets well.<br /><br />The construction is firm & solid while more than likely being able to handle the riggers of the road well. The lower price point SB3 felt far more plastic.<br /><br />Overall, I would still be a price taker at the price point it's been listed at. The value is there even at full price. Its going to hold up, it's going to tackle most situations you can through at it, and the jog wheels feel like they are well put together.<br /><br />I highly recommend this piece of gear.",[],B07QMQ5YGK,B09X7JJDSR,AELWR5K5MXAWCSPUK62XNGRB5LOQ,1592500039684,11,True,2020-06-18 17:07:19.684

4.0,Loud at low volume. Static and no sound when volume turned all the way down.,"This is the second electronic drum kit in this price range I've purchased for my kids to learn some basics. The first one was a different brand (KPP). The volume control on it did not work, it was max volume all the time so I returned it. I looked through several of these kits, they're almost all made in China and are basically reskins of the same model. I took a chance on this one.<br /><br />Good:<br />The sound reproduction is better than the other kit. At least on par with a decent keyboard.<br />The response is better than the other kit with less delay between hitting and actually producing sound.<br /><br />Bad:<br />The strike zone is a lot smaller than the other kit. You really have to hit it in the middle to get a response.<br />When the volume is set to the lowest setting, there is actually no sound produced, just a slight static buzz.<br />The volume is still very loud even when turned to 1 above 0.<br />Pedals are flimsy and hard to find a way to actually use.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />Kit is a lot smaller than you'd think. The product image has measurements, I suggest you look at them and get a ruler. This is for small kids, not more than 7 or 8.<br />Some of the answered questions for this product are clearly copy/paste fake reviews.<br />This is not a ""professional"" kit by any stretch of the imagination. This is basically a higher quality toy. That being said, kids have fun with it and it does help get them interested in music.<br /><br />At this price point (~$55), it's about as good as you can probably hope for. I do wish the volume worked better, I don't always want to hear the noise when the kids are in their bedroom upstairs.

4.0,Stiff and loose if that makes sense,The connection between the c clamp and the arm itself is very nice and smooth. Doesnt feel like metal on metal contact at all when using the swivel function. The only real gripe would be that it doesnt sit in there very tightly but then again if it did it woudnt swivel so easially. The movement to the rest of the arm is very very stiff and once you set it in place it is not going to move unless you swivel the unit.  The cable hiding feature is very nice and makes the arm look very clean and premium. I wish the flat mount came with the unit but the c clamp is what I would have gone with anyways since I just got a desk as well and do not want to drill holes in the top of the thing just yet. I like how the c clamp has a bumper on it so it doesnt damage the surface its being attached to. Think thats about it. Really a lot for a little boom arm but when investing the same amount of money as you would into a rhode ps1 or blue boom arm then I would say this is very good but may not be the best value for the money.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810YHZfHh-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810YHZfHh-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810YHZfHh-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000SZVZ74,B000SZVZ74,AHEL7236WOEYEARYMWTDB2X2PP2Q,1617076438292,1,True,2021-03-30 03:53:58.292

I am not sure whether this review posts only under the Tony Rice 13-56 strings, or if it posts for all gauges of the monel strings. I play the 13-56 strings. I flatpick mostly bluegrass, with some swing and also  plain old strumming to songs. Sometimes heavy strumming. They are said to have a neutral tone that brings out the natural wood sound of the guitar.  When I first tried them, I sensed what they were saying, and I liked them a lot. I have 3 guitars, and within a short time, I had a set on all three. They last a long long time, by the way, and they feel and sound great. . But recently I put a set of PB's  on one of my guitars, just for the heck of it, to see if I liked them like I used to think I did.  The result of that experiment was that I did not like them at all. I gave them a couple weeks even. Yuk. I got the monels back on and yes!!  Funny, but I  don't perceive the natural wood sound concept anymore. I guess that I am acclimated to the sound of these strings. I love them.

5.0,Red Stain Mahogany Great for Beginners and Professionals,"Love, love, love my Kala ukulele! I'm new to playing the ukulele. Before purchasing, I did quite a bit of research. So, I've read hundreds of reviews on many of the ukuleles offered on Amazon. After comparing value to quality, I decided on this one. It is great for a beginner like myself, but I could also see it as an instrument professionals would enjoy as well. It's quality is amazing! Beautiful mahogany wood and details. And the sound is fantastic! If you've never played guitar or any stringed instruments, like myself, this is a good place to start. You really only need to learn 4 chords and you're set to play hundreds of different songs. It's pretty dang cool! Also, I highly recommend getting the Limited Edition Red Stain. It's really cool looking and is a deep, rich red that looks really cool! Also, don't listen to all those people who gave this ukulele bad reviews because of tuning issues. It's going to take awhile for your ukulele to get in tune because you have to keep adjusting it as you play it because the strings stretch naturally.

Every one of the 12 tuners was loose enough to rattle in their holes.  The tuner keys were loose on the tuners.  Every single one had to be screwed down. The strings were rusty/pittted and had to be changed immediately.  Before I decide to return it I will have a luthier check it.  Contacted KORG and their response was a very polite we're sorry, you can send it back directly to Amazon.  The materials are good but I think I understand now why LAG can't break into the US market.",[],B0045XOZXQ,B0045XOZXQ,AEIT267NVBO64URCVORFXEOFRWWA,1489625520000,1,True,2017-03-16 00:52:00.000

5.0,Great product.  Great value.,"I just placed my used Cordoba inside my new Crossrock case.  The plush blue interior provides a near custom fit and keeps the guitar snug so it won't bounce  around during transport.  The case looks great too.<br /><br />For added value, you get a banker type bag that contains a cleaning cloth, 10 picks and a key ring with a leather pouch for guitar picks.  Convenient for attaching the key to your case as well.<br /><br />Other qualities to consider.  It's a little lighter than a similar case I have for an acoustic guitar which just means I'm less likely to drop it.  It's also slightly smaller than the used and very damaged humicase I'm replacing with the Crossrock.  Potentially, however, it might create a tighter seal to keep excess humidity out of the case.  I have yet to live somewhere where there's any danger of my guitar getting too little humidity.  Consequently, my gel packs for two way humidity control are completely liquid.<br /><br />Anyway I'm very pleased with the Crossrock crw600 for classical guitar.  So nice having a pristine interior.

4.0,"Better performance, fewer parts handle.","Our usage is for interpretation at church from English to Spanish. We like this product because it had lesser moving parts. Instead of having a battery pack, the base unit and two earbuds the headphone line we thought this would be better having only a lanyard in the device. It also makes it easier to clean because many headphones you'll see people's ear plaques inside the rubberized headphone.<br /><br />We did change out the lavalier mic for a court reporter mic which covers over the whole mouth. The lavalier mic picks up a lot of additional ambient noise and makes a definitive hissing sound. Once we bought the other microphone for a couple of hundred dollars that hissing was eliminated. This area causes us to bring down the star rating. I believe if they would go to work picking up the better microphone to speak into we would raise our star count.<br /><br />One of the deciding factors for us was also having a case that had only one wall plug in. This device will hold 32 smaller units and all charge through one heavy duty cord and the case is really well-built. Instead of having the aforementioned multiple units. We would have to have 32 USB plug-in outlets, 32 outlets for electricity, 32 cords, 32 earbuds + 32 base units on 32 lanyards, that's a ton of cords and items to tend with. With this simpler side mount,, we simply have 32 lanyards and 32 ear devices and one charge station. Of course the single charge station makes it easier to carry these units in a single mobile platform.<br /><br />Lastly I think it would be convenient to have a place to hold the speaker mic and a little bit extra storage for our repurchased microphone. But it's not a deal-breaker.<br /><br />We found this product to be worthy of the investment we put into it and yes you can add as many devices as you can imagine.

5.0,Innovative Design and Quality Feel,"I picked up this Hercules EZ-GLIDE Tripod stand to replace one that I use for auxilliary percussion. I needed a straight stand that's sturdy enough to support an LP percussion table that attaches to the bottom section and holds 7 - 8 lbs. of instruments and accessories.<br /><br />I was immediately impressed by the innovative functionality of this one after using so many of the traditional type over the years. To raise and lower the stand, you simply pull up or push down on the top section. The amount of resistance you feel can be adjusted by turning a small yellow tab at the bottom. That mechanism ""clicks"" into position so the change in tension is precise. This makes height adjustments a one-handed and completely mindless action. No more cranking and wondering how much you should tighten.<br /><br />The top section is aligned so you can't turn it. However, to adjust the mic direction, you can either turn the bottom section at the base or turn the mic clip itself. The clip comes loose from the top section with a quick-release so it's easy. The clip is also clamp-style but high quality with a firm, cushioned grip.<br /><br />The tripod section feels sturdy and connects with a traditional screw-down mechanism. Also, the legs seem to have the right amount of resistance as to not flop down when you lift the stand.<br /><br />The tubing used for this stand is thicker and sturdier than average but retains a light weight. The bottom section is also a little taller than normal which I'm excited about as it allows my table to come up a few more inches.<br /><br />I've only just received the stand so I can't say much about the durability overall.

I'll update accordingly if not, otherwise I highly recommend.",[],B000EEL9R0,B000EEL9R0,AHSEUPHWABAKNUWPZJOLLGDM47FA,1413219877000,0,True,2014-10-13 17:04:37.000

5.0,Best Value Portable Field Recorder!,"I bought my DR-40 from B&H, not Amazon, but just thought that I'd post here too to help support the product and anyone on the fence about buying, as it's been very useful to me. Like most people interested in these types of products, I needed a decent way to record good, crisp audio for DSLR filmmaking... while on a budget. As you probably already know, the Zoom H4n is by far the most-used recorder for this type of work... and if you're here on Amazon looking at the DR-40 instead it means you're probably wondering why it is over 100$ dollars cheaper... well let me set your mind at ease! The DR-40 is worth every penny, and in my opinion is a far better value than the H4n, for basically the exact same audio recording performance.<br /><br />A few months ago when i was looking at gear, I was loathe to pay the $270 the H4n, so initially I went with the H2n instead, guessing (wrongly) that i wouldn't miss it's not having any XLR ports, and especially after reading of it's impressive 20 hour battery life on just 2 double AA batteries compared to the H4n's ridiculous 2 hour battery life (you can see my review here on amazon if you're interested in reading more)<br /><br />but after i got a killer deal on a shotgun mic, XLR became necessary, so it was back to researching online. This is when i came across the DR-40. It's basically a copy of the H4n, just cheaper (and better even, at least in some ways). First off, battery life for the DR-40 is better than for the H4n, as it's got 3 double AA batteries instead of just two. It also has the awesome dual mode recording, that has honestly saved my audio more than once... someone shouts or something happens louder than you anticipate, normally the nasty clipping and distortion would have rendered such audio unusable, but the wonderful little dual mode backup track is right there, however many decibels you want underneath, waiting to save the day.<br /><br />The XLR cables lock into the recorder, so that's nice. External mic quality is essentially exactly the same as the H4n's. You can youtube if you want, there are tons of examples. THe DR-40 is also much more useful supposedly for real line-level recording, through the 1/4&#34; jacks,  i.e. plugging it into a mixer... this is something i haven't yet had a chance to try, but i mix sound for local rock band, and i'm excited to see what sort of quality i can pull straight from the board during a show.<br /><br />Drawbacks: some people say it's too &#34;plasticky&#34; and it does feel a little cheap, but hey if you really think a bit more secure feeling H4n is worth over $100 more, than go for it. Although if you drop the H4n the poor little onboard mics are probably screwed, at least the DR-40 has some little roll bar things to help protect them on top. I also very slightly prefer the H4n's button layout, as it is a quick one button move to switch between the external mics to one of the XLRs... but it only takes like half a second longer to do through the menu on the DR-40 so it's not that big a deal.<br /><br />The H4n has a lot more effects options, for musicians plugging guitars and basses directly into the recorder and stuff like that... the DR-40 doesn't have much to offer there, but this was a non-issue for me. Some people have also complained that the DR-40 does not have an additional 3.5mm out like the zoom does, but if you have 3.5mm mics already, like some lavaliers or other mics such as as the rode videomic pro, no problem, rode offers a cheap little XLR to 3.5 converter.<br /><br />So, long story short of it: DR-40 trumps H4n because: Much cheaper, bettery battery life, same level of audio quality, + some cool features not seen on the zoom.<br /><br />TL;DR<br /><br />Save your money, by the DR-40 instead of the H4n, you won't regret it.",[],B005NACC6M,B005NACC6M,AGKY5PRYS7NO7RPA6Z654UD3BLSQ,1398178807000,4,False,2014-04-22 15:00:07.000

It shouldn't take an engineering degree to design a hook that attaches to a desk, but whoever designed this thing should probably invest in one.<br /><br />The thing is made entirely of plastic, which actually seems to be pretty good quality. The problem, however, is the mechanism the designer used that allows you to tighten it onto your desk. The problem is that as you twist the bottom portion and the flat bit presses more firmly against the bottom of the desk, instead of growing tighter the bottom bit just starts bending down. Its simple physics: Equal and opposite action. The desk pushes back against the bracket and since the bracket is flimsy plastic, it bends. This means that the hook end up kinda loosely attached to the desk..

3.0,"Good for a backup Strat, but not a main guitar.","Bought this to put into a '93 MIM Squier I found at a pawn shop with dead pickups. They will not be staying in the guitar (plan to get a 920D Gilmour pickguard), but I needed a backup electric with single coils to use and this is, as noted by others, dirt cheap. I bought these with VERY low expectations on how they would sound.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-These pickups (at least the ones I got) are actually silent, and have zero hum, which I found shocking for the price.<br />-With the exception of the screws and an output jack, it comes with everything needed. Just solder the ground and the output jack, and you're ready to play.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-These pickups are BRIGHT and BRITTLE, often sounding like nails on chalkboard when playing high on the neck. Depending on what you're playing through, you WILL need to trim the highs, and possibly even the high-mids if you can.<br />-As noted by others, you WILL need to drill new holes into your guitar for the screws. Be sure you have the tools to do so, or at least be able to improvise the tools to do so. Also, you may need to shave the neck area of the pickguard a bit depending on what type of neck your guitar has.<br />-The switch will occasionally pop when using it.<br />-The tone controls leave a lot to be desired. You have a lot of mud, then maybe a few degrees of something playable, then nails on chalkboard.<br /><br />As I stated, I bought this to use for a backup guitar. You can get some interesting sounds out of it when running it through an effects chain, but it will never be something you'll play leads on.<br /><br />So, if you need some pickups for a partscaster that will be a backup to your main Strat, these will do.

5.0,Thank you George!,"I've wanted this little jewel for awhile now, when I saw it for the price I got it for, which is beyond a deal, maybe a steal,<br />I jumped on it. Not a fan of batteries, it can run on a wall wart, it is very frugal on batteries though, surprising. Very quiet, very, very, if I turn the gain all the way up, which is not needed, it will get a tiny bit grungy. Being able to switch between three amp setups  is awesome, combine a delay clean sound with a mid scooped loud crunch sound, or a clean chorus with a bit of crunch, nice nice!

4.0,Good Deal,"It's hard to argue with this when you consider the price they charge for what it does.  It works and it's by far and away the best cheap option to go when you want to record audio to your computer.<br /><br />I use it with Audacity.  At first, I found the recordings to be rather noisy with lots of hiss.  After fooling around for a couple hours trying to figure it out, I thought it was just because the audio interface was a cheap product.  The next day, I fooled around with it more and realized I needed to turn the mic input down (in Audacity) and turn up the gain halfway on my mixer.  When I did this, it completely shut out the hiss.  I've been making great recordings since.<br /><br />It's a plug and play tool, but it should come with some kind of instructions for problems like I experienced.  However, they are just a matter of setting up your computer properly because this thing works very well.<br /><br />For those wondering about latency, obviously there's some.  You'll get latency with any type of recording device.  You just have to account for it in the settings of your audio editing program.<br /><br />The only other thing that is a legit complaint is that playback is a bit noisy and hissy in the headphones if you have the headphones turned up high.  It does not sound like that in the recordings, though.  So, it's OK.  I can deal with it<br /><br />This is a very good product and can't be beat for the price.

4.0,One star off for bad documentation and poor speakers,"I recently bought a used 61 key portable keyboard made by a popular low end Japanese consumer electronics company from a seller off of craigslist.  This was several months ago and I use this keyboard mostly for transcription and chord changes (tenor sax is my main instrument).  I have finally started learning keyboard as I want to learn chord voicing and comping.  I can practice at work as I usually have 10 to 20 mins between clients (I also work in multiple offices, so portability is important).  My two issues with the 61 key keyboard is the size and the keys.  ""Portable"" clearly is relative term and as for the keys, well,  I'm pretty sure this company has shaped used water bottles into keys, 'cause that's what they sound like to me.<br /><br />The EK490+ literally is half the size of the 61 key keyboard.  I received this in 3 days - reasonable.  The EK490+ is a follow up to EK490 - and as far as I can tell, really did not change a whole lot - and yes - I'm willing to pay $21 dollars for a black instrument (and the '+' sign, I suppose).  The Midiplus homepage does not even have this instrument listed, so I don't know if other than the color, there is a difference.<br /><br />The description describes a 9v power supply - which the EK490 came with...mine did not have a power supply - or so I thought.  After looking over the EK490 comments,  one reviewer mentions the cleverly hidden power supply in one of the end packing Styrofoam - mine was empty, but the ps fell out when I took the EK490+ out.  One problem solved.<br /><br />My main complaint is the documentation and support and lack there of.  At first I thought this had the same problem as the EK490 - the built-in midi player and the tuning - they have added a ton of vibrato - even to the piano - to hide the pitch variability;  then I discovered the modulation wheel needed to be turned off (Voice 2  disables pitch and modulation- again not documented anywhere).  Once I figured that out, on to the next issue.<br /><br />The sound output is  really awful and probably the speaker. Better than a toy, but no where near any quality even for practicing.  Headphones are much better, but the volume has to be turned down on the headphone, ow distorts loud tones (again - figured by trial and error).<br /><br />The best part - the keys, the KEYS, THE KEYS!.  For semi-weighted, very nice.  I have noticed the activation point is slightly different on different keys (and have read this complaint about other midi controllers) and for advanced playing, this could be a problem.<br /><br />I have not explored the midi features as much as the portable keyboard features, other than to test it works - it does, though there is a slight delay, probable due to the HDMI audio encryption/conversion on my monitor.  I haven't had time to test this.<br /><br />Pros:  the keys, the KEYS, THE KEYS! Yes - I love the keys - they are nice semi-weighted keys - maybe a little heavy, but nicer than any 49 key $100 midi keyboards I've tried.  Midi keyboard with pitch and modulation wheels plus small size and complete instrument.  Excellent for practice/learning.<br /><br />Cons:  lack of documentation - this is not a keyboard for a novice or child unfamiliar with electronic keyboards.  Also poor speaker sound output - speakers are what you'd expect for the price.  Also a music stand would have been nice.<br /><br />I really should give this a 5 star rating for all the features and reasonable price, but the lack of documentation both in the description as well as online and in the box really prevents me from doing it.<br /><br />Note:  works perfect for my portable need, but now I need a case - guess what - good cases are nearly as expensive (really good ones twice as expensive as this EK490+, ow it's nylon bag and (? box packing) for $30...","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x5e4J0jkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x5e4J0jkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x5e4J0jkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07PM1NDQZ,B07PM1NDQZ,AE7APYINQT2LRPCBQDCMI5IKUHSQ,1558984597541,4,True,2019-05-27 19:16:37.541

That's on a $1600 Pbass. I've only heard of that from Dingwall & Warwick at 2-3x the price.<br />These strings are longer than some though. I had to string them through the body on the BE&A strings & yet the D was a bit shorter so I strung it through the bridge. TBH I can't tell the difference.

While there is nothing wrong with the item, and I am satisfied, the reason I cannot give it five stars is because of the bore size. I've seen multiple complaints about not being able to actually play the horn. The trick to this is to actually take a knife, sharp edge or dull, does not matter, and hollow the bore even more so than it already is. The larger the bore, the easier the horn is to play. Adjust as needed, and boom you've got yourself a working Gjallarhorn. On the new horn the bore is even smaller than that of a French Horn, which makes it almost unplayable. I must stress that it is not as low of a pitch as most people would think or enjoy, so if you're looking for something with a low pitch, this item isn't for you. Overall, quality horn.

3.0,"Great sound, not so great quality - 2 sets failed in 2 1/2 years","I really wanted to like these speakers. The sound is impressive, but the quality is lacking. First, I'll talk about the quality. I had to return the first pair at just under a year. Anytime I got over 60% volume, the amp would cut out. Mackie CS was great. They sent me a replacement pair with very little hassle. The replacement pair lasted for about 1 1/4 years, and now these are on their way out. There is a selector switch on the back of the main speaker that lets you set it to either L or R. The switch is on the fritz. You have to play around with it to get sound, otherwise you get a lot of static or now sound at all. They're now out of warranty. On a side note, I now noticed that Mackie doesn't have direct service anymore. You have to take the speakers to a service center that may or may not be close to you. I am now replacing these with CV XD4's.<br /><br />As far as sound is concerned, these are definitely high end. The sound is clear and crisp. The BT is extremely easy to connect to.

4.0,Much nicer than putting thick 'packing materials' on the walls. Part of a sound solution,"I love sound absorption panels as replacements for the thick foam pieces that look like packing materials. They look like art, but they are denser than canvas or framed art, and thus can be part of a sound absorbing strategy for bare walls. Of course, do not assume you will be able to tell a difference in sound once these go up. You would need to add a few of these, caulk around windows and outlets, strategically place thick rugs and carpets and add heavy furniture to make a big difference. But this is certainly an attractive aspect of the sound dampening design. You will need more than 3 panels, so these are way more expensive than the thick foam pieces. Especially since the 48 x 24 size doesnt cove rmuch of the wall. It is about the size of a regular/large painting. Lastly, if you look at the advertisements below this ad, you will see larger pieces of the same type of panel available for a little more than half the price. So, you should buy this piece when you know you want the artwork in the particular color and hue. Otherwise, you're better off shopping around.

4.0,Very nice Ukulele for the price and sounds great!,"I would have given 5 stars if it were not for the minor faults with quality control of stain color and the saddle; despite those errors the uke plays wonderfully and displays well on the wall when not in use.<br /><br />Rec'd 07/20/18<br />I inspected the entire ukulele visually and tactilely; No noticeable flaws; made sure the tuning pegs were securely fastened; checked the action height @ fret 12 and it measured 3.25mm, a deduction for that; I took it down to about 2.5mm. The saddle is definitely bone!<br />The color is actually red, really red, like a cranberry red (the photo misrepresents the true color); instead of reddish brown or medium brown mahogany (this is a replacement of another ukulele which was more natural in color that had playability issues). It is a stain so the grain does show. I would like to see Aklot be more consistent in with stain color (another deduction). The fingerboard has a nice grain pattern to it.<br /><br />After tuning and stretching the strings I played some chords, notes and scales; then went up and down each string at every fret; no buzzing.<br /><br />It plays well; general appearance shows as a nice ukulele, with exception to the color; sounds very good ( I am considering changing strings to a brighter style, maybe a fluorocarbon or the D'Addario titanium; it will give a different look than the Aquila white Nylgut, also).<br />This Aklot solid mahogany top concert uke is nicely constructed.<br />The gig bag is okay, I've seen better for $$$ and even worse cardboard hard-shell guitar cases; the tuner is great to have; the cloth can be handy; the other extras aren't really needed; don‚Äôt know why there are strap pins and the kit has a clip-on strap.<br />If you don't want to put out $250 or more for a nice ukulele that doesn't look or feel like a toy but is a nice solid wood top ukulele that sounds like a more expensive uke then this could fill the bill.<br />11/29/18<br />Recently I restrung the uke with D'Addario nylon strings because the Aquila strings were wearing over the frets. The nylon strings sound much better. Still a great little instrument!<br />Also, because of the color I hung the uke on the wall for the holidays!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I1WaPZ+LL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I1WaPZ+LL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I1WaPZ+LL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sO7erTh5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sO7erTh5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sO7erTh5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81V26bD1NoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81V26bD1NoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81V26bD1NoL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B072JT9WLF,B09N3PBT9S,AFN3K7EGQSKJP6SENH4TPLSSL7CQ,1532233459760,6,True,2018-07-22 04:24:19.760

5.0,A Truly Beautiful and Perfect Instrument for a Beginner,"Purchased this violin after it had been recommended by an instructor.  I had the chance to hear it first before purchasing it and I was impressed with the quality of the sound.  This is my first time at trying my hand with the violin and, as an absolute beginner, I was more than impressed with the fact that I managed to get a perfect note out of it as soon as I got rosin on my bow.

5.0,Surprisingly effective for jazz,"I purchased this on a whim locally and thought it was going to be relegated to my barely used collection of beaters. I play mainly jazz and my go to beater is a big, fluffy [[ASIN:B00080SEAU Vater VBVB Vintage Bomber Bass Drum Beater]]. Much to my surprise, this one is easy to control and play through a full dynamic range.<br /><br />Considering that the Bomber is fairly one dimensional, this is actually a versatile alternative because you can choose the oval leading edge for a lot of projection, or turn the beater head ninety degrees to the flat side for tone. Either way, though, you can play as lightly or as heavily as you want. I will say that for maximum projection you will definitely need to mic your bass drum because while the beater is solid wood, it's also fairly light. For me that is not an issue since I play mainly lighter, quieter type gigs. For rock drummers this may or may not be an issue that you need to take into account.<br /><br />Since I play heel down and off the head, and depend on rebound this beater is ideal. Because it's so light I imagine it would literally fly for heel up players who demand speed. Honestly, I have not tested it for that.<br /><br />It's sufficiently long at 7 7/8 inches to reach my strike zone on my 18"", 20"" and 24"" bass drums. I usually adjust beaters to strike just above or below center, but the length will work to hit dead center with most pedals if you prefer that type of zone.<br /><br />I own all of the Vater beater models and among them this one is probably the most versatile. It will work for rock, blues, Country/Roots and just about any other style.

It looks really nice, feels exotic, and sounds louder than I would have expected with such a small sound hole and small body. Well presented package. I like that it's in G Mixolydian.<br />The tuning is extremely sensitive. I mean, turning the peg a teensy wiggle will raise or lower it a half step. You have to work it very carefully. That would be fine and dandy if it stayed in tune. I get it set, but it won't stay at pitch enough to play it longer than it took to tune. I haven't give up. I continue to tune it daily and pluck a bit. But so far, it hasn't improved in two weeks.<br />I've been playing guitar for too many years to state anymore, but here's an odd fact that might be helpful.<br />I worked at Wood and Strings Hammered dulcimers in the 90's, and I tuned and shipped dulcimers all day for about a year.<br />So I'm used to using a tuning wrench. I know all the tricks. I tuned it a bit high for a day or two to let the strings stretch. I push down and up on the strings to get them to set. So far, the tuning hasn't been stable enough after a couple of weeks to even enjoy experimenting with it. The effort it takes to move the peg a fraction of a turn frustrates me and defeats the purpose of creative relaxation.<br />I'm really disappointed. If the strings finally settle, I'll update.

I don't have to yell out the steps - just normal speech gets the job done - so I'm less exhausted after teaching.  The system performs flawlessly.  I have purchased extra foam wind screens to put on the microphone for other instructors.  The Zumba instructor uses it before my class and she no longer has to shout (but she does anyway.)  The mic is hyper-cardioid and consequently is very resistant to feedback.  I have been able to make if feedback by standing directly in front of the speakers - not recommended.  The batteries last about 6 hours, so I use rechargeable batteries and keep a couple of spares with me.

Pegs also limit the types of strings, as bullet ends can't be attached to pegs, (not that I use them, but a simple observation).

Unfortunately, Cordoba uses the cheapest tuners available and two of the tuners were faulty.  One was so loose that there was a quarter turn of play in it and that made it nearly impossible to keep in tune.  That's too bad because we both like my Cordoba Concert uke which uses the same tuners.

I like the way it feels, plays, sounds, and looks.  Yes the top does have a orange-ish color, but it makes it look more unique.  This is also the first guitar I have owned that has a built-in tuner and I really like that too.  But, the best part is the sound.  For a small classical guitar, it has a nice, rich, full sound.

5.0,As good as you've heard,"I picked up the tin whistle about 2 years ago, so I'm still a novice.  I've experimented a bit with homemade quenachos, but this is my first proper low whistle.  I've had it for a little over a week now.<br /><br />My Kelpie came in a custom-made felt sleeve with a velcro-fastened flap.  I didn't see this listed in the product description, so it was a nice surprise.<br /><br />This thing is pretty!  It's well made too.  Between the materials and the construction, it should have no problem outliving me.  I didn't find any tooling marks or scratches either.  The seams are tight and the edges are clean.<br /><br />After it's warmed up, the intonation is good as far as I (and my tuner) can tell.  The first octave is exactly on the mark, with the exception of the C#, which is flat unless you give it quite a bit of extra pressure.  My understanding is that this is actually desired - it allows the cross-fingered C natural to be in tune.  The second octave is a little sharp, but you can under-blow it to get it in tune.  I'll need some more practice before this comes naturally for me, but it's possible.<br /><br />My hands are almost exactly average for a male, and I can reach the bottom hole without too much trouble (using piper's grip, of course).  I can't move as fast as on a high whistle, but I'm still improving.<br /><br />The mouthpiece is very comfortable.  The ridge down the middle of the bottom side is very slight, and I don't notice it at all while I'm playing.  All of the edges and corners have been relieved so that they don't cause any discomfort.<br /><br />I've seen plenty of condensation form in the windway, but for the most part I haven't had any problems with clogging.  The only time I've seen it clog is before it's warmed up, and the house has been unusually chilly lately, which doesn't help.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with this whistle.

They didn't even last 0 seconds. They simply do not stick to foam.

1.0,Really wanted this to be better...,"I'm returning this bridge because of several issues. I spent 2 days trying to make it work on my Gretsch Rat Rod because I saw a couple others say they fit their Gretschs perfectly, but I ended up putting the stock bridge back on it and resolved all of the issues within 5 mins. I'm not going to bash this company because of this one incident. The bridge was $21... it's a $21 bridge. It is built very nicely and I truly am not sure exactly where the problem is... I just couldn't spend anymore time on it to investigate, especially after reinstalling the stock bridge.<br />1. When I first installed this bridge, I noticed how much easier it fit over the bridge posts vs the stock. I thought that was good but I think it may have contributed to part of my rattle. I checked it with the posts provided and it fit loosely over them as well. The thumb wheels felt cheap and unfinished as well, so I reused the stock posts and wheels.<br />2. I don't believe the radius is the same as my Gretsch. I did see someone say they felt it was a 14"" radius and my Gretsch is 12"" radius. I think they are right. I couldn't get the action low enough (E or e) but I had fret buzz on d and g strings and sometimes on b as well... however, this was before I isolated some of the buzzing.<br />3. The buzz... so ultimately, even after raising my string action back up to twice what it should be, I still had buzzing on d, g, and b strings and started getting buzz on e as well. I could press on the side of the rollers and change or eliminate the buzz which is what led me to putting the stock bridge back on and decide to return this bridge.<br /><br />It would be great if better dimensions were given for this part. It would also be better if the ""ears"" on the end were not so thick. I think the rollers sit higher than the stock wedge style seats because even at the very lowest setting, the best string action I could get was about .065-.075"" which isn't horrible but I would have liked to get it a little closer to .050"" especially if I decide to go with lighter strings (I currently run 10-46)",[],B0BDRN53VT,B07LG17TNX,AGXXNM4ZSQTUNMTNUWCZXL2QBOLQ,1673532771808,0,True,2023-01-12 14:12:51.808
3.0,Not Bad for the Money.,Not bad for such a cheap unit but don't try to use it for distances any greater than 20' as the signal is likely to break up on you.  The hand held is a pretty good mic.

3.0,ZOOM H1 - Notable Problems,"I purchased this Zoom audio recording device to mount on top of my DSLR so I could record music videos of live concerts better.  Everything looks good on paper.

Will be recording along nicely then all of a sudden it just drops the level of the audio out of the sky.  When I'm looking at the wav file in my editor I can see the wav go from big to smaller size and I have to make adjustments accordingly.  Which sucks. I'll have to try it without the audio level control on and see if I can keep from clipping and also see if it still does the drop.<br /><br />Also, as one poster mentioned, it drained the battery that came with it over night when I left the battery inside it.<br /><br />Since I use rechargeables this isn't so much of a bad thing and I kind of welcome it. AA rechargeables don't take long to recharge.<br /><br />The sound recording that this device achieves is so so for me.  Its better than the canon dslr audio.  I guess you get what you pay for.

5.0,Highly useful for live play.,"This is a solid pedal that does exactly what it should. I have it to go along with my Morning Glory V4, and I have only two highly specific complaints about it.<br /><br />First is that the remote jack on the Morning Glory itself is super close to the input jack, making it kind of difficult to configure this on your board if you use angled cables like I do (I got around this by using an MXR low profile cable for the remote jack, and a D'addario angled patch cable that fits right over it for the input jack; see the included photo for an example of what I mean).<br /><br />The second issue is that its small size makes it kind of easy to miss when you're in the moment playing live; I made the mistake of putting it next to my tuner pedal, and rather than switching to the higher gain sound as intended, I've accidentally hit the tuner and silenced the whole guitar mid-song (only at practice, thankfully).<br /><br />Neither of these complaints are really due to the remote itself, hence the five-star rating. It works perfectly, is well-build, and does exactly what is intended. There are just a few complications around it that have caused me some grief, though nothing that can't be dealt with. If you have a pedal that this works with, it's a solid investment.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P+H5GmuML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P+H5GmuML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P+H5GmuML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B06XYQLXGC,B06XYQLXGC,AH3LBFF7XML4Q3UESV2ZC7HFL2WQ,1578804927556,2,True,2020-01-12 04:55:27.556

It also caused inconsistencies between how far they came off the wall, causing the pattern to be ruined.<br /><br />Requesting a refund.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RHKuHLllL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RHKuHLllL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RHKuHLllL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pW-FEWRpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pW-FEWRpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pW-FEWRpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71270luf8lL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71270luf8lL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71270luf8lL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71C5DU+z06L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71C5DU+z06L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71C5DU+z06L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ful657FfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ful657FfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ful657FfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B071Z7155V,B071Z7155V,AEGQJSOX7F3VEU72J4GXSN7UV4KQ,1597968566531,0,True,2020-08-21 00:09:26.531

To me this means it is light, has a fast action, is easy to play, and sounds like a flemenco guitar - brassy trebles, solid base, some tonal complexity, and some ability to shape the tone with technical modifications.  This is not a performance guitar, but that is not the price point.  Its sound is quite satisfying in my living room, and played informally.<br />  I had looked at other flamenco guitars in this price range.  This one is superior.

3.0,"Sounds Great, but Looper just an Ad for the Pedal (not included, of course)","I like the sound of the unit, and the flexibility of the effects flow. I wouldn't buy this again, however, because you actually need the $90 proprietary foot pedal to make the looper useable. You can start the looper buttons with your hands, of course, but your hands need to be on the guitar. So it's basically impossible to use this feature. The way I see it, the looper function on this unit is more like an ad, or like trial software: it's not really functional until you shell out the extra dough for the pedal. I mean it works, but it's just impossible to do with your hands.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Line6 leaves it to the consumer to figure this one out, and so I find it a little misleading when they list the looper as a feature here (which was one of the reasons I chose this one in the first place). Admittedly, it should have occurred to me before I bought it, but this left a bad enough taste for me that I don't think I'll get another one of their products. Also, there are volume fluctuations when you do overdubs of guitar parts, so it sounds crappy anyway. The original track you lay down gets a bit quieter when a new loud part comes in, then gets louder again when the new part is quiet. So that's a bust.<br /><br />What Line6 should have done is program a metronome (the thing already has a tap feature for the delays), so that a loop could be pre-programmed to go for x many bars at a given bpm. Then you wouldn't need the pedal, because they could give you a one-bar click track countdown to get you ready for the overdub, hands-free. But that's more work for Line6 programmers, and would take away from pedal sales!<br /><br />Ah! Oh well, they already got my money, so what am I grubbing about...<br /><br />EDIT: A couple years later, and I'm less impressed with the sound of this unit. I spend countless hours twisting dials and looking at the little screen. It's extremely difficult to dial in a good sound. Very frustrating.

I drove myself crazy trying to track down the mechanical rattle I was getting, convinced it was something loose on my drum kit.  Nope.  Worthless, cheap little clips on the XLR cables rattling away every time I hit a drum.<br /><br />For anything other than percussion, you will probably be fine.

4.0,Very sturdy. Great on the back when using guitars. Not sure about portability.,"Great, sturdy stool for playing the guitar. Especially helpful when using a heavy guitar to keep back strain down.<br /><br />I have been sitting on small stools and drum thrones without a backrest when playing my Gibson Les Paul, which is a very heavy guitar. Even with the height adjusted to bring my thigh nearly parallel to the floor, the weight of the guitar and position while playing eventually gets to my back. Enter this stool.<br /><br />Due to the adjustability of the backrest and footrest, I can sit with my thigh at the proper angle and relieve some of the strain on my back. The various threaded knobs make it easy to dial in a position without any tools after assembly; speaking of assembly, the stool came with a very clear and vibrant instruction pamphlet, and I do mean pamphlet because it went together in just a few steps. I have only had a chance to play for a few sessions, but so far the results have been great, especially for my back!<br /><br />Despite the adjustability, the overall stool feels very sturdy. There is a little creaking from the feet as I settle into it, but it does not feel like anything is shifting. That said, the posting does mention that this stool is easily portable due to the adjustability; while it is a great stool for use at home, I am suspect about the portability because the seat and backrest are pretty big when assembled. To throw it in my car, I would have to probably separate the top portion from the folding base; at that point, it would fit in my car, but it still is not tiny.<br /><br />In addition, the whole thing came packed in a very large cardboard box with a lot of bubble wrap and the dense type of soft foam that thankfully does not shed little balls but does take up a ton of space in the trash. I appreciate my items coming intact, but I also do care about sustainable packing. In some of my other reviews, I have given and taken points for sustainable packing. For this stool, I really like it overall, but dropped it from five to four stars due to 1) it not really being that portable and 2) having so much foam and bubble wrap that I literally filled an entire large black trash bag just with the shipping padding from this stool. I would suggest to the manufacturer looking into that shredded cardboard packing padding if it does not throw off the cost too much.<br /><br />Despite that, I would recommend this stool to those that need a stool to play the guitar from, especially if they need some back relief.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NouW4RRuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NouW4RRuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NouW4RRuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61u06syDv1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61u06syDv1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61u06syDv1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712fKB33WML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712fKB33WML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712fKB33WML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71O7H4TJSVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71O7H4TJSVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71O7H4TJSVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ocHUkrCjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ocHUkrCjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ocHUkrCjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xW92wX4oL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xW92wX4oL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xW92wX4oL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BYL3CL2K,B0BYL3CL2K,AGE2YIJLISBKCAYKDOEOIBJ3I43Q,1680581884413,1,False,2023-04-04 04:18:04.413

4.0,Best violin mic for tone and feedback!,"This is, hands down, the best way to amplify a violin if you want excellent tone and no feedback. I've been actively playing violin for 24 years, and many genres, including classical orchestra, a progressive Celtic band, and rock style modern worship. I've used a piezoelectric pickup(K&K), a clip on mic (meyer's feather), and now the Stat V.<br /><br />The piezo was great in loud rock settings when feedback was an issue, but even with an impedance matching preamp, the tone was frustratingly nasal. And the little discs under the bridge muted my natural tone.<br /><br />The Feather mic was amazing. I got emotional when I heard it reproduce my violin's true tone for the first time. But it created endless feedback on a loud stage with other musicians.<br /><br />I can't describe the relief I felt when I plugged in with the Stat V for the first time. Gorgeous tone! Rich, warm, full! And I stood right in front of my amp, cranked it high, and.... no feedback! YAAAAS! I also loved how little it changed the weight and structure of my violin. The mic fits into the kidney of my bridge, and the cord sits lightly on the tail peice.<br /><br />The only improvement I would make is with the cord. It's proprietary to Schertler, and wasn't long enough for me to move around much on stage. And wasn't short enough to use with the preamp on my hip. I ended up shelling out dough for the 6 meter cable, which was SO expensive! Hence the 4 stars.<br /><br />And, of course, service at the electric violin shop was amazing!

4.0,"Most handy tuner on the market, bar none.","I love this tool. For starters, I‚Äôve never had an issue tuning my guitars before. I‚Äôm practiced enough to tune quickly by ear. However, this is much faster and kind of fun. When I received this item for the first time, it took me a few moments to set it up for my guitars. I kind of got ahead of myself and started setting it up for each one of my guitars - which I have many. It can be a tedious task to label each guitar alphanumerically with just the turn dial.<br /><br />Tuning is simple. Just pick your instrument and start with your lowest string (eg: low E). Once it‚Äôs in tune, the light will turn green and emit a small vibration pulse. But be careful as you have to then move it to the next string. I‚Äôve had the Roadie 2 start tuning my low E as A because I wasn‚Äôt quick enough - which was my fault during the learning process.<br /><br />I‚Äôve used it many times already and absolutely love it. I can‚Äôt see life without it at this point. And for clarity, I‚Äôve dinged them one star for their Roadie 2 app delay. The tuner is only so programmable on its own with Band Industries saying more functions will be in the app. My Gibson SG setup for standard C awaits this app release.

5.0,Great way to set a baseline when tuning acoustic drums.,"There is a small learning curve using the device for the first time.  The manufacturer provides very good written instructions and recommendations and hosts a number of how-to videos on that video hosting site.  Using the device on each of the drums of my kit was a new experience so I was not completely sure what I was doing.  A few days and a few videos later, I retuned each drum and felt more confident that I was doing it correctly.  They sure sounded correct...and better.<br />Again, this tension measuring device measures tension at each lug around the batter and resonant heads.  Tensions are all set equally across a single head then the other head.  The drummer must choose what tension to set (based on guidance from the mfg.) each head to and whether the batter and resonant heads are set to the same or different tensions.<br />Checking the tuning by ear should be done and the tensioning adjusted by ear to your liking.  The manufacture suggests that the tensions be set based on the guidance included with the device to let the construction material and size of the drum drive the sound of the drum.<br />Last two things: any defects or damage to the hoops and bearing edge of the drums may make it impossible to tune each lug to the exact same tension AND I purchased a 15 inch plastic 'lazy Susan' to make turning the drum easier and not scratch the table I was tuning on.",[],B0002E2TVM,B09RBFKS1X,AGHGQYAGCBVUZWJXYIVTFDD5KOBQ,1649624743748,3,True,2022-04-10 21:05:43.748

The ends are well designed and because of the way they are made the are really easy to hold onto while plugging them in or unplugging them.<br />On the ends of these cables the xlr plugs have a part of them that gets smaller in diameter resulting in a place where you can actually hold on to the them when pulling them from where they are plugged in. Not only does this help with connecting the cables but it also makes the ends look really nice and (if you're a sound tech nerd like me) give it an elegant look.<br />The outside of the cables is a woven nylon material. My experience with this kind of covering on cables is that they tend to last longer than other cables so I would guess that you'll get a good service life out of them.<br />When I plugged these cables in they performed as expected. There was no buzzing or hissing noises when the gain was properly set. The connectors worked smoothly and fit very nicely into a microphone and a mixer. They also released easily when pulled from where they were plugged in.<br />This is a solid product that, based on my experience and time with the cables, should last a good long amount of time.",[],B0BDKHDNFS,B0BDKHMB1G,AG46Y66V6P77QT55VM3FX7MEBLUA,1677697199759,0,False,2023-03-01 18:59:59.759

4.0,Solid quality and smooth sound in a nice package.,"I‚Äôve used this JBL Eon One for a couple years now and I love it. It has been rock solid, reliable, and consistent. I use one for small Dj or acoustic gigs, and 2 when doing a small band or club gig. I‚Äôm a part time musician/sound guy/ Dj. I do about 6 gigs a month. I have hauled these things all over San Diego from outside weddings to indoor clubs, to backyard patio parties, to military retirement ceremonies, you name I did it.  Sound is smooth, bass is tight but solid, highs are not harsh but do have plenty of presence. I really like the sound quality and while they won‚Äôt ‚Äúbump‚Äù like my powered 18‚Äôs and my QSC k12‚Äôs, they do just fine for 80% of my gigs. They are my go to system for ease of transport, ease of set up, and versatility. So what do I not like about them. A couple things, they aren‚Äôt as powerful as some other systems out there. They have enough, but not a ton of power.  The mic inputs as others have said are very weak. I have to use an external mixer when using mics, the mic inputs are just weak sauce, even when set to mic setting. No pre-amps, dumb cost saving effort but a failure in my opinion.  The extension poles store neatly in the back but are sometimes very difficult to slide into their storage slots when doing it in the dark. I mean, I‚Äôve spent 10 minutes just trying to get the extensions to drop in place....finally had to go find a flashlight. If you don‚Äôt line it up just right, it won‚Äôt go.  Can‚Äôt connect multiple units via Bluetooth. I can only send to one speaker at a time and that means if I‚Äôm doing a party via Bluetooth I have to use an external mixer and Bluetooth receiver to connect to both speakers. It would be nice if I could link 2 units together.<br />Overall I‚Äôve been very satisfied and recommend these for a variety of situations. I‚Äôm upgrading to the EV Evolve 50‚Äô s to get some more power and volume, but I will miss my JBLs. They have never once let me down, and I‚Äôve pushed them pretty hard at times.

4.0,"Great, but you can tell it's not a high-end strat","I hadn't play electric guitar for many years, and decided I wanted to get back into it.  I used to have a Strat a long time ago, and wanted a similar feel, but had no motivation to spend the money for a high-end guitar.  I looked used, but felt that the Squier strat would be a better fit.<br /><br />The guitar looks great, and plays pretty well.  I was impressed with the factory setup - nice action, no buzzing frets.  The body is a little thinner than a standard strat I believe, which feels great to my style of playing.<br /><br />One issue I noticed was that the strings were a bit misaligned - my high E was closer to the edge of the fretboard than the low E, which is occasionally a problem with high-neck pulloffs. At first I thought the neck was installed at a slight angle, but eventually I tracked the problem to the nut - it's installed shifted about 2mm off-center.  This is an easy fix that I'll do myself (a guitar shop might even do it for free), but it may speak to some issues in quality control.<br /><br />Even with that one issue, I'm still very happy with the product, and I'd definitely  recommend it to a beginner at this price.

This was very tricky as I did not have a screwdriver with a head big enough to catch the grooves and had to borrow one. Once I did this, however, things went pretty smoothly. One of the hangers' holes were not lined up just right so when I drilled the holes evenly using a level, the final result looked a little crooked.

This may not be the case if you're a tall man with broad shoulders, but then you probably wouldn't be playing a soprano ukulele anyway.

5.0,Overall a solid 5 in my opinion,"As noted by the previous reviewer, dimensions are smaller than indicated. It's a bit pricey for an entry level recorder, but I personally find it much nicer in terms of sound quality and features as compared to the typical varieties you will find at your local brick and mortar stores. I have not used it extensively yet, but wanted to give some initial impressions since this is a new model with little information available at this time.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Small, compact and very lightweight.<br />Nice feature set, record in PCM or MP3.<br />Can accept external power via micro USB.<br />Accepts standard AAA batteries as well as rechargeable Ni-MH.<br />Can specify battery type for more accurate recording times.<br />Transfer files to PC for editing. Manual split possible using PCM.<br />Accepts up to 32 GB microSDHC (16 GB more cost effective).<br />24-bit recording.<br />Built-in speaker and table top stand.<br />Option to use external microphone (powered 3.5mm).<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Feature set limited for those with more elaborate needs, but you should know that going in.<br />Standard USB would be nice, but a minor con.<br />Recording levels may not be satisfactory for die-hard audiophiles.<br />External speaker is mono, but you can use headphones so this too is minor.<br />Plastic construction feels a bit flimsy considering the price, but keeps weight down.<br />A little bit pricey if not on sale when you consider other options (including other Tascam models.)<br /><br />On the whole though, the cons are fairly minor for casual/non-high end use and I still feel like it warrants a solid five.

Go to Black Arts Toneworks' website to see their full line up; the coven is next on my list.  IMPORTANT NOTE.  Initially, this pedal was really HUMming badly when I first plugged in and stood before Asgard.  I referenced the internet and found this to be a common problem.  I then applied one of two common remedies others have found and took off the back plate and put it back on.  Fixed.  Dead silent now other than some hiss on par with all my other pedals.  The other fix others seem to have found is simply time, as if the transistors need to burn in, but the backplate trick did it for me.  Weird.  Aside from that, I use it on the Germanium and Lo settings, tone backed off a smidge and gain maxed, then boost it with a Guyatone OD2.  I feel the price is arguably fair because the quality is good but other companies have also produced great products as well for cheaper, however, if this is where you have arrived, just take the hit and buy it.

5.0,My favorite pedal,"This was my first pedal after using a multi effects pedal for years. I think that if you are to buy any pedal, a compressor should be one of the first pedals you buy if not the first. And this is a great compressor pedal to buy. First, it has a very small foot print to fit on your board or just to leave on the floor and not be in the way. In terms of tone, I spent a good week tweaking this thing to discover the tonal possibilities. The dip switch located inside has four on/off switches to vary attack and act as low and high cut filters. There is a volume knob, and a dry/wet knob to regulate how much of the compression. There is also a battery compartment for a 9VDC battery. Finally, there is a three way switch that regulates High, Medium, and Low compression. The high compression setting, does generate considerable noise as is mentioned in the manual. Overall, I think anyone could get the appropriate level of compression with the myriad of settings available or even use it as a boost pedal.

3.0,The Matrix strikes again(and that hurts a bit),"First thing that comes to my mind,  is that Getting to create an expression /Wah sound is really confusing on this pedal. It‚Äôs the hardest interface to control EVER, and I have had many multi effects in the past(Boss, zoom, Digitech and Korg). This  Pedal was a positive jump for Digitech with the DNA2 chip sound-wise, but the interface is horrible and not intuitive at all IMHO.  Even The older RP100, 200 and 300, which do have an older chip, are so much more intuitive thanks to the real control knobs for all the different parameters of effects. The RP150, 250, 350, and later on the 155, , 255 and 355 were when Digitech really started to shine and simplify their compact pedal interface. I wanted to like this pedal for the sounds, but I hate it for its interface and nearly annoying matrix. It‚Äôs a cool pedal for just goofing around at home, and a cute piece if you are a collector (like me lol), but NOT a gig worthy. I also had to open it few times to adjust the foot switch levers so they make the contact on the circuit board..I mean..you get the picture..it‚Äôs also really lightweight plastic chassis so it won‚Äôt stay put unless you Velcro it.

3.0,Not bas for the money,"I have two of these systems. One with the headsets. I use them for the occasional wedding or party gig, maybe 3 to 5 times a year. Initially I was really impressed with the mics. They aren't Sure or Sennheiser quality, but they sound good especially for the price. I even recommend them to a bar owner friend when setting up their Karaoke sound system. One of the selling points was you can get replacement mics for about $25 from their website.<br />  Battery life and range is good, as with all mics line of sight to the antenna is a must. They are made from plastic with a metal cover.<br /><br />  So here's the downside to them.<br /><br /> It's pretty easy for performers to overwhelm the mics so they clip and distort. Turning down the gain on the reciver only does so much to fix this.<br />  The unit at the bar is about 3 years old and gets used at least once a week has one completely dead channel, with a second channel starting to go out.<br />  The units I own get babied unlike the one at the bar. At 4 years and about 20 uses my oldest unit has a dead channel.<br /> The lavalier set is problematic, but even top quality sets can be when the person you have mic'd is moving around a lot.

Now, I understand that Cary is not in the tube biz but these EH tubes could drive a person to solid state, even after a hundred hours burn-in.<br />So, I set about replacing the supplied tubes with New Old Stock, excepting the output tubes which are Psvane KT120-Z CB (great tubes, still stable after hundreds of hours.) The 6SN7 tubes I chose were NOS RCA Blackplates. The amp was singing beautifully, and I might have left well enough alone had I not suspected that detail and resolution were being smoothed out in favor of a ""creamy"" overlay.<br /><br />Which brings me at last to the subject of this review: the Psvane cv181-tii. I'm in love! Now that I have more than 20 hours playing time on the these tubes, they're settling in and their character is apparent. They surpass the respected RCA tubes in every way; openness, clarity, texture, articulation, timbrel accuracy, realism, etc. All the audiophile buzzwords. The RCA is not a bad tube, far from it, but these Psvane are outstanding! It's almost as if the amp has been upgraded to something higher up in the product line.<br />If and when I need new tubes elsewhere in the amp, Psvane will be my first choice.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lk8iYX2bL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lk8iYX2bL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lk8iYX2bL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00N4L28HK,B00N4L28HK,AEM6MEYHQPJKVHNZE3CWVUVXA2YQ,1560539025646,7,True,2019-06-14 19:03:45.646

1.0,"Didn't ""lock""","bought two sets and have a dozen Schaller installed on other fenders.  My goal has been standardization.  You know - grab the wrong case but the strap still works.<br /><br />All the Schallers fit each other bought 20 years apart.  The two sets of fenders bought 60 days apart don't even fit each other.  To be fair, one set doesn't fit itself = the strap lock do not lock!  The button is larger on the outside diameter than the groove on the locking side. Meaning the locking mechanism never engages due to physical restrictions.  The same button also has a top shoulder with very tight tolerances for sliding into the locking portion.  By taking two sets, and combining them I got it too work.  However, I will give this set to a student and by Schaller for myself.  The defective set was returned and I was allowed to keep it!  Therefore, fender will have no feedback on the their QC and continue to fail.<br /><br />Massive QC problem but I feel the problem is deeper at the design level.  Generally, you think reverse engineers would stay out of design space but not here.  The chamfer on the locking pin is gone, the throw of the lock is shorter.  The V seems more U shaped which just makes it harder to put on.<br /><br />Combine these design elements with poor QC and you end up with a recipe for paying fender to your guitar at risk.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just grumpy, but I do not think it is cool to sell strap locks that don't lock, from a cloning supplier who didn't clone but just made cheaper.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YrJxwE5jL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YrJxwE5jL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YrJxwE5jL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B002AQNGIU,B096K2LZKH,AHI2Z7PKYY4AXB6YA3DJTM4S4YKQ,1466947881000,6,True,2016-06-26 13:31:21.000

The harmonies are the most natural out there. The gender mods sound great when used in moderation. Easy to figure out right out of the box. Love the looper, but the Sound Check feature is a huge game changer!! My preset building has gotten faster and better. I never used doubling effects with other units because it sounded odd in the monitor when setting my patches... no more. I can sit back and use sound check to hear how it will ACTUALLY sound to my audience. The mic preamp or &#34;gold channel&#34; is simply magic. My Beta 87 mic never sounded so good. I am just overjoyed with the build quality, simple-yet- total control over my sound. If you are a solo guy and get sticker shock from those other guys, don't feel like you are settling for an inferior product getting this one.. It is just different..and in my opinion, better.

4.0,Great interface,"I put off buying one of these for a while. I didn‚Äôt want to spend the money. I thought I could get the same sound from a Scarlett 4i4. I  used the scarlet for a while, and truth be told it is a good interface. However, it is not in the same league of the Apollo twin. Not even close. After I received the Apollo twin, I did side-by-side comparison recordings, and there is a very audible and distinct quality difference between the two. Furthermore, the scarlet runs off USB bus  power, and thus only has so much amplification, including for monitoring, before the sound gets distorted. The Apollo twin suffers from none of these problems. it is an incredibly high quality, audio interface, and given the quality of the materials, it is worth what they charge for it. Having said that, here are a few nits:<br /><br />My biggest gripe is that it didn‚Äôt come with a thunderbolt cable. I guess I should read the fine print. But at this price point, they should be including a cable. The unit is literally worthless without the cable. It‚Äôs like receiving your favorite toy on Christmas morning only to be told that it needs batteries and there are no batteries. Do better UA.<br /><br />It comes with ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù plug-ins. They are pretty good. Although at this price, I don‚Äôt know why they don‚Äôt give you a coupon to choose two or three free plug-ins. Unfortunately their plug-ins are a fortune.<br /><br />The big knob is slippery and the edges are sharp. There are no grooves for your fingers. They should smooth it and add some grooves.<br /><br />The on screen interface is not scalable. Buttons and text are tiny. you would think at this price point they would at least give you a screen interface that was legible.<br /><br />Their software package that you must install to use the unit is massive ant over 3 GB. This is because they include every single plug-in they sell. I know why they do this for marketing and sales, but it‚Äôs wrong to load all these plug-ins without giving the user the ability to uncheck them and not install them. It‚Äôs actually quite  intrusive and totalitarian (ie not user friendly). Do better UA.<br /><br />You have to twist the power cord to ‚Äúlock‚Äú it into position where the unit won‚Äôt turn on. This is a good feature, however, they should make it well known because evidently many many people, including myself, couldn‚Äôt figure out how to turn the unit on, they could‚Äôve saved themselves a lot of support requests by simply putting a little red tag or something on the line.<br /><br />The LED indicators on the unit are not high resolution. They barely move, regardless of whether the content you are playing is soft or loud. They should have a much higher resolution LED at this price point.<br /><br />There should be two headphone jacks, but there is only one.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pURYZVM3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pURYZVM3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pURYZVM3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08NYLP33B,B08P1TS5YN,AGMAXNTNRKWGOKW6BN553L5ZAW3Q,1679927397961,0,True,2023-03-27 14:29:57.961

So when Amazon emailed me my experience with this company I originally chose one star and commented with &#34;I still have not received my package.&#34; Two days later, I received a message from the seller themselves and asked if I had received the package. I replied with a no.

5.0,5 Stars for what it does for the money!,I've been a guitarist since I was 9 and I'm 45 now.  Unfortunately my voice was not as blessed as my voice but I still enjoy singing.  I've got quite a collection of microphones-decent but all under the $500 price range. For recording vocals this is my favorite.  The tube really rounds out the rough edges in my voice gives nice warmth to it over all.  I did a lot of research on the web and sites like gearslutz.com and found that you can change out the tube on this and really change the characteristics of this mic.  I purchased a few different tubes and now the mic is even more versatile.

You can also connect it to the mic input of most laptops and it will work. It does some  interesting things and has actually. It runs on battery for several hours and has bluetooth (i only have receive working right now but I don't plan on using that feature anyway). If you plug this into pro audio gear, roll the lows off.

3.0,Somewhat flimsy but will work for lighter microphones,"The basic issue that I have is that this stand is rather flimsy. As an example, the tubular portion that inserts into the clamp is simply rolled-over sheet metal that has already started to bend on mine, causing the stand to lean to one side or another. For better support, a metal rod should have been used. The rest of the stand does work, although there is much flexing as it is re-positioned. I suspect, a fair amount of sound would be transmitted to the microphone without a shock mount,  I am using a large-diaphragm condenser microphone with a shock mount, albeit a somewhat light one, but that seems to be about the upper limit of what it can reliably. The pop-filter is actually the same one I had been using prior to buying the stand. The filter works nicely and is secured attaches to any stand and easily positioned.

2.0,This pedal does next to nothing.,"Bought this because we were doing a no amp gig, so used this for the bass to go directly into the mixer and then into the PA. This arrived a day before the show and  I was astonished that the knobs on this pedal had almost no effect at ALL. The Harmonics knob did next to nothing. I'm not talking subtle, I'm talking next to nothing from all the way left to all the way right. The Drive knob was similar, it did next to nothing through the whole range of the knob. I was astonished.<br /><br />I thought it might be that the bass was active, so I tried it with a passive Jazz Bass, same deal.<br /><br />I really expected this pedal to add some bass grit/overdrive from the Drive knob. Nope.<br /><br />I really expect this pedal to add some richness/harmonics from the Harmonic's knob, you know that fuller sound, thicker sound, and a brighter sound as harmonics are emphasized. Nope.<br /><br />The pedal did work as a DI, but I cannot speak to the noise or sound quality of the DI signal, we had no monitors on stage, and it was a quieter gig. Couldn't really discern the sound of the Bass going out the PA.<br /><br />I should have sent this pedal back. Again, it arrived right before the show, so didn't have time to source another DI/Bass Drive/Bass Preamp.<br /><br />I'm not a pedal snob, about half of the pedals on my guitar board are all Chinese clones. I have little money, and I go with what works. At the time, this Wine Cellar just hit the market, so there were only a couple reviews of it, so I took the risk, and lost. Now you have this review to inform you.<br /><br />Maybe I'll open the pedal up, and see if the pots are actually connected to the pedal's circuit, or if they're there just for show?<br /><br />I've never experienced a pedal like this in 25 years of playing music.<br /><br />Be warned.<br /><br />EDIT: after writing this review, I dug this pedal out of my pedal junk drawer, and tried it again. And again, it does very little in terms of modifying your bass's sound. At the end of the gain and harmonics knobs, it does change the tone a bit. So most of the knob turn does nothing, and maybe the final 10% of the knob's range it changes the sound a bit.<br /><br />That made me think that maybe they built these with the wrong taper on the potentiometers? Maybe they should be logarithmic but they used linear taper pots? Or Vice versa? If an electrical engineer could take a look inside, I'd really like to know. I'd change the pots if it made this pedal usable. Please let me know if you know why the knobs on this pedal don't do anything, and if it can be fixed.

2.0,So disappointed....,"After going through some hit and miss with some random tube amplifiers on the used market, I decided that I would research amps and buy something new that was exactly what I was looking for.

Well, needless to say, it isn't the Uber Amp.  Not even close.  The gain channel has NO BASS.  Even with the bass control dimed, no bass.  I played it through a Laney 1x12 with a metal oriented speaker and a 2x12 with 2 Eminence Legend 128's (which produce ample bass plugged into my Peavey Bandit).  There is plenty of drive, more than I will ever need, but sound is nasally and thin, because there is no bass!  The clean channel is delicious.  I was able to dial in a wonderful tone with the onboard EQ.  With a good clean channel, you can add pedals to get whatever sound you want using pedals and the effects loop.  The problem is, the effects loop is noisier than a box full of wet cats.  Even with no volume, the effects loop is producing an ugly mess of noise.  Total deal breaker.

2.0,"Well built, but lacks analog controls for soft and sustain pedals.","TLDR: Half-damper doesn't work. But other than that, it works well.<br /><br />The circuitry inside this has four single-pole-double-throw (SPDT) switches and no potentiometers, meaning it can only provide discrete control. The first two switches operate the left and middle pedals (soft and sostenuto), allowing for ON/OFF functionality of both.  The second two switches are for the right sustain pedal.<br /><br />The sustain pedal's circuitry is little more complex, but suffice to say it's two switches in series that would allow selection of three discrete points along a voltage divider circuit. With the pedal released, it returns a fixed 3% pedal. With only one switch engaged, you get a fixed 23% pedal. And with both switches engaged, 63% pedal. (% here is determined based on the voltage selected in the voltage divider circuit. The piano may perform additional scaling based on calibration) That, in theory, could give you three pedal levels -- off, light, and full pedal.<br /><br />But, alas, the mechanics of the unit would rely on one of these two sustain switches engaging before other, and frankly that's difficult to achieve. The manufacturer placed a thick piece of tape on one of the sustain switches in the hopes that one switch would engage before the other, but in my testing, that doesn't pan out. First, they placed the tape on the wrong switch, meaning that you'll hit 63% and jump right past the 23%. Even if they could get that mechanically working, controlling with your foot would be nearly impossible. And even then, you lack the full analog intent that Yamaha has for this action, which would allow a gradual pedal increase from 0 to 100% over the entire stroke of the pedal.<br /><br />Per Yamaha's documentation, the Soft pedal should also be analog - but the reality is that there's less need for analog on the soft pedal, so it's not a game-changer. There's hardly a noticeable difference in the soft pedal, regardless of whether it's analog or discrete.<br /><br />Aside from the missed marks for failure to properly implement analog half-damper control, this unit seems like a solid unit. If you're not interesting in half-damper, then by all means, this is the pedal for you. If you want half-damper, look elsewhere as this unit can't do that.",[],B087NDYYLX,B087MY5K2R,AGIYYNP5WVVE6IDO44ECT47T2NNQ,1624124872586,10,True,2021-06-19 17:47:52.586

5.0,Great drum kit and quality craftsmanship.,"I didnt purchase my kit from Amazon (found it much cheaper elsewhere. However my kits color is a Limited Edition and didn't come with a snare so I purchased a DW performance series 14x8 snare. I love the sound this kit produces and the quality of the kit is second to none. I got a huge cymbal set that came with 8 Meinl Classic dark custom cymbals (I only have my 16in hi-hat, 18in crash, 20in crash, and a 22in ride cymbal. I still have 4 more cymbals to set up before its complete but figured I'd write a review on the kit as it only had one. While I'm not a ""verified buyer"" on Amazon for this kit (because the price is way too much) you can find this kit much cheaper. Now my particular kit didnt come with a snare but even after purchasing the kit and snare I still managed to stay way before 1k for a price tag. Most DW owners really do take care of their equipment. So even buying 2nd hand your still getting a great deal so long as the kit is in good shape. This was one of the few times Guitar Center came through with great prices. Before this kit I had a 7 piece Gretsch Catalina Drum kit (maple of course). I swapped the batter heads on my toms and will switch the bass batter head to Evans EMAD2. I just need to swap it out.... While I still have my 7 piece Gretsch kit ive come to appreciate the smaller kits as I'm not tempted to fly off the deep end hitting every single tom lol. My snare sounds amazing as well. The original DW batter and reso heads are great but I'm into metal and needed to tune my toms down. The evans black chrome heads are great for that, plus my dw performance snare has new 500 hazy bottom and a HD dry snare head. Aside from the snare my toms do not need any moongels. I absolutely love my snare as its tuned low (I have a piccolo 13in that has a wonderful ""pop"" to it. Overall ive always wanted a DW kit and going from an old Mapex V Series (made of basswood) is a huge step up. My dream has finally come true. I also managed to get a great price on the meinl dark classic custom cymbals. This kit is a shell kit and you will need tom mounts to either hook the toms to a rack or to a cymbal stand. There's no hardware included within this kit. The two kits shown do come with snares which will save you money but do some research 1st as prices do vary. But I finally feel like my dream has come true... I love playing metal, I have this DW Design Series Limited Edition Midnight Blue Satin along with an awesome deep DW performance snare. I did swap the brand new DW heads for Evans Black chrome and my toms sound like thunder. I still need to put my Evans EMAD2 bass batter as I've put a kickport on the reso head. I also have ddrum red triggers which proves to be useful when doing live or studio work. Not that the kit needs improvements on sound but it does allow for crazy sounds to be produced. Its a difficult toss up between my 7 piece Gretsch Catalina kit (I wrote a review on those as well. and my DW set as both are made of maple. But time will tell.... I purchased a set of G2 coated evans heads for my Gretsch which I havent been able to put them on since I took down the kit for my DW. But I'm not sure if its the way DW laid the wood on the shells but they sound very different than my Gretsch kit and I LOVE it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716n-QF2zsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716n-QF2zsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716n-QF2zsL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MnG0PREtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MnG0PREtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MnG0PREtL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PZmNRMcUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PZmNRMcUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PZmNRMcUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71chuk6loFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71chuk6loFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71chuk6loFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sDH7MWSBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sDH7MWSBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sDH7MWSBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00F8Y3ITS,B06XHKT1SG,AFHYDFCLH7GUDRC7BCOCBMFRMMHQ,1562025536578,4,False,2019-07-01 23:58:56.578

5.0,Tone is EVERYTHING! This DI SOUNDS FANTASTIC!,"I am a long time sound tech and honestly placed my DI choices on the bottom of my audio list for years. Everyone knows a $50 DI is all one needs right? Wrong!<br /><br /> My eyes were opened after a touring guitarist used a Radial JDI DI with a Martin acoustic and I was simply blown away with the sound.<br /><br />After that eye opening, jaw dropping experience this DI is NOW my direct box of choice.<br /><br />The product is impressive the moment you open the box and hold it in your hand as it feels like a piece of vintage military equipment as this thing is like a brick in your hand! I am talking made out of heavy gage metal and loaded with that wonderful sounding Jansen transformer... Quality, Quality, Quality is all I can say!<br />The buttons and the ¬º & xlr jacks are of military quality of days gone by and just as the feel of quality worthy to be connected to the most expensive prized instrument you may own.<br /><br />In this day of import  "" cheep everything"" you just got to own one of these DI boxes if you are the seasoned pro or in your 1st rock band. Please don't put junk in your signal path; your ""tone"" deserves this quality product.<br /><br />I recently had a visiting guitarist again using his prized Martin acoustic showed me his prized hand built legendary active pre / DI. After I plugged him up and after one listen I suggested he try this Radial.<br />He warned me that his passive pickup required a preamp.<br />After going direct into this JDI I had plenty of gain using a Yamaha Ls9 digital mixer so my suggestion is even if you are sold on active please consider this passive device as with audio in general less IS more.<br /><br />On that guitarist recent return visit he mentioned he was looking forward to using my great DI box again.  How often does a DI impress? The Radial JDI impresses!<br /><br />After all my years in the business this is one of the few products I make a point to show and explain how impressed I am with this product when working with visiting musicians as everyone deserves good tone!  I have yet to find anyone that has any idea what good sound is that was not blown away when plugging in to this beauty!<br /><br />Remember you are only as strong as your weakest link.  If you want to impress when you plug-in I suggest buying this DI and the best sounding guitar / instrument your budget will allow as ""tone"" is EVERYTHING!<br /><br />I have been installing and engineering PA systems for years and if I could make one recommendation to any "" player"" or fellow sound tech is this Radial JDI is the one single piece of equipment I consider a must have.<br /><br />This Radial has my absolute highest recommendation. FYI,  Radial does make a stereo version of this same JDI if you are a key player or play multiple guitars.<br /><br />Remember...

Noticeably cleaner, 60hz hum-free power vs. supplying your devices independently.  Each device gets properly powered -no issues with under-powering.<br /><br />(TIP: If you have any hum or buzz issues, I suggest using 90¬∞ instrument cables so you can arrange the signal flow perpendicular to the power flow instead of parallel, for reduced noise)<br /><br />After securing the extension wires to my pedal board, I was able to easily and neatly power my usual 3 or 4 pedals.<br />There was just enough length in the wires (about 3.5"" x 2 in/out of each plug tip) to adjust the distance between pedals to my liking, without too much slack to tidy up.<br /><br />Also note the initial wire from the 2 pronged plug box can conveniently be disconnected from the multi-connector extension run. This allows for clean, easy pack up after a gig - just disconnect your devices/pedal board from the main wire to store separately without the plug box dangling or potentially pulling apart your cable wrapping.

It will not screw in all the way on either the Blue Yeti or the shock mount.  I ordered a replacement thinking it was just a defect on one, but nope.  The second adapter had the same issue.<br /><br />On top of all of this, the stand just doesn't stay in place.  The desk mount slides often.  It's just not made well.

I also did not experience any problems with hot preamps and did not have to use the pad on my mic.<br /><br />I was planning to use Audacity, but since the Studio One software comes with the audiobox, I gave it a try and it's very nice. I was concerned it would be too complex for a simple voice-over track, but so far it's been very easy to edit and manipulate the audio, even for someone with zero sound production experience.<br /><br />I'm very happy with my purchase and recommend this to anyone that wants to step-up from a USB microphone.",[],B00154KSA2,B072FL4G1W,AGMF7GOUJCO5EYVJJ7DAUVQ66WBQ,1289488023000,7,False,2010-11-11 15:07:03.000
4.0,iPad 2 Compatibility,"I've just received my unit and haven't had time to do much more than use my favorite Guitar apps, Ampkit+ and Garageband, through this yet with my electric guitar and Bose headphones. I was putting off buying the unit because of the confusing compatibility issues with fitting the iPad 2. So, when my unit arrived today I fully expected to see a separate sleeve in the top of the box as they seem to appear in the UK (at least in the setup videos some have done), or a note to contact Alesis to Register and request the sleeve. Neither was the case and the sleeve is already inserted into the unit as part of it. Everything just works. No other mention is made of the sleeve. iPad 1 users just need to lift the clip in the center and remove the sleeve to use the unit.<br /><br />Next to figure out is how to remove the iPad from the unit.

He DID suggest upgrading the tuning knobs, but was still surprised as to how long the guitar stayed in tune after making it sing like a cat in the rain. Finally, he commented on the beautiful tone it produced. When I told him what I paid for it, he couldn't believe it. He agreed that it's not really necessary to spend what he spent for his Fender Strat, for a nice sounding guitar like my new Donner. He said that he would definitely gig out with it.

4.0,"Bizarre Bazaar Experience, However‚Ä¶","I originally ordered the Fender CD-60S Solid Top Dreadnought Acoustic Guitar‚ÄîAll Mahogany‚ÄîBundle on April 27, 2020. On April 30, I received a polishing cloth with an Austin Bazarr imprint on it. That was it, nothing else, although Amazon advised the complete order was delivered. I waited a few more days to see if the rest of the order would arrive. Nothing. I sent an email on May 1 to Austin Bazaar.com asking when I could expect the rest of the order. I didn‚Äôt receive a response until four days later. I was contacted by ‚ÄúAndrew‚Äù from Austin Bazaar who stated that he didn‚Äôt know what happened to my order but that I had received a refund. It was true, after checking my bank balance, that I had received a refund for my order but was not notified earlier of that action. Also, I was never told of the problem with my order. Truly bizarre customer service.<br /><br />I truly believed the Fender Bundle was a great value. So‚Ä¶.I tried again and reordered on June 4, 2020. I was given a deliver window of up to two weeks for delivery. Astonishingly, I received my order in only two days! As sideways as the first attempt was, this time was perfection! The guitar bundle arrived in great condition. The guitar‚Äôs hard case is bullet proof! It is better than what I purchased for my 12-string years ago, which was costly. I did not expect such a quality item in the bundle. The Fender CD-60S is a tremendous value for the price. Up until now, I‚Äôve always had spruce top guitars. The solid mahogany top has a rich tone. Whoever the tech was that set my guitar up at Austin Bazaar really cared. It had played wonderfully since day one. It has held its tune exceedingly well and has been an absolute pleasure to play. As for the rest of the bundle: tuner, strap, picks, strings (all bear the Fender logo), Instructional DVD, and (another) polishing cloth, are as advertised. No substitutions. The guitar and hard case alone are worth the price that I paid. Although the bundle items aren‚Äôt the highest of quality across the board, they are extremely serviceable, especially for a beginner. I am most please with the quality of the Fender bundle and very please with the turnabout in customer service from Austin Bazaar this time.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716dUbLwhLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716dUbLwhLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716dUbLwhLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XNGSMxuWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XNGSMxuWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XNGSMxuWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00BMJ3OFG,B0BTMMYM7C,AG5OWYEXGCQOU265J24KOU7YK6RA,1593224796410,19,True,2020-06-27 02:26:36.410

5.0,Perfect fit for Yamaha NTX Series,"I was looking for a gig bag or case for my Yamaha NTX700, I really didn't want a hard shell case and I came across this case. I was hesitant to purchase this case online at first because I didn't like the idea of not trying to fit the guitar prior to purchasing it. After reading a review by someone who purchased it for Yamaha APX series, I decided to take a chance. The guitar fits really well in this case, the foam pads give the guitar excellent protection yet very lightweight, it's snug--no swishing around, the guitar stays put. I like the 'backpack' straps so I can carry my guitar on my back. I also tried this case on my other guitars just to see if they fit in this case, who knows I might get another one. It won't work too good for regular classical guitar due to the body depth, otherwise body width fits perfect. The neck is not completely rested on the support. So, not a good idea. It works well with the 'flamenco' guitar because the body is not as deep, but not for one with wood pegs. Overall, this is an excellent case, or gig bag, or whatever you want to call it. I am glad to have bought it.",[],B001891ANI,B0749YR91Y,AHD7P7F6ZLUKJ3ECUX7TBFZ5C5GA,1332800623000,8,True,2012-03-26 22:23:43.000
4.0,Very strong.  Very cheap...,"Don't be fooled by speaker stands.  The PSTND2 is a better quality stand than the PSTK103.<br /><br />I purchased the PSTND2 standing thinking it would be light weight like the 103 version.  It is not.  It is very heavy (about 20/25 lbs?).  Very strong.<br /><br />The only thing I did not like is that there were all sorts of scratches and nicks on it like it had been used.  But, it is so shiny you can tell that it has not been used.<br /><br />I also do not like the fact that when I place my speakers on it (Pyle Pro 1299AI and 1594A), the speakers shake because the hole on the speakers is actually WIDER than the actual stand.  I guess I should not be so worried however.  It's not like the speakers are going to fall off right?<br /><br />If you want a very STRONG speaker stand, for a cheap price, this is the stand to get.

It sounds good and seems to keep the P's, T's, S's and all those other hard sounds out.  My room has a turquoise and white theme so this is close to the blues that I have.

4.0,Outstanding cartridge for the price but ...,"This is an outstanding cartridge for the price. Like others, I noticed that the sound considerably opened up after an initial breakin period. The detail is incredible - the DL-110 effortlessly tracked even the most difficult passages with unbelievable neutral purity. In comparison on a Technics SL-1200, it made my similarly-priced Ortofon 2M Blue sound thick and unidimensional. Moreover, the cringy sibilance I heard with the 2M Blue on some loud highs (regardless of careful setup) was completely gone. The warmth of the 2M Blue was also gone, but I prefer the change on my system. I became totally addicted.<br /><br />My only disappointment was that, after about 18 months of light-to-moderate use and careful handling, the DL-110 started to pop occasionally. I noticed it first on some jazz records and verified with other carts that it was the DL-110. The sound is clearly not a vinyl click but an electrical pop, as if there is an intermittent short.

Also with the Shock Mount and pop-filter is a brass Euro converter threaded sleeve, to go from U.S. to Euro threads, and if your like me you cant have enough of these.

4.0,Dark and moody sound. Good value for price but not best in its price point.,"This is actually a pretty decent but dark sounding microphone. I read a lot of reviews indicating that this mic was a steal and I think I have to agree. For me if it didnt work out it was only a hundred or so and I could eat that cost. Now a few things i DONT like about this mic, starting with the mount. I had to send my first one back because out of bod the little nut that holds it didnt stay and the mic couldnt be mounted. This to me is a poor design and I wonder if my next one will fail and what I will do next. Ill have to see if it will fit in any of my other shock mounts as a plan b. Second thing is that the nut once you get it tight enough to stay can actually be hard to loosen again and that kind of also hurt my fingers trying to get the little wing nut to loosen. I dunno maybe its me but its just not ideal.<br /><br />So the sound? Well I just got a matched pair of fat head 2 microphones and so I spent some time messing around with different variations and placement etc to see how they stack up including my least favorite mic everyone loves the SM57. I was ready to throw the apex under the bus because it sounded terrible compared to the SM57 and I was shocked. Then I realized like a homer i mislabeled the tracks in PT and was thinking it was the wrong mic. What a difference because I thought how the hell is a SM57 that much better sounding than a ribbon? Ok my bad. What i noticed about the tone compared to the Cascades is that its definitely much darker and kinda moody for a lack of a better word. I can see some really good applications for that. However I read some folks removing the cover from the ribbon and I think I will try that and compare it. Im over all pretty happy with this but it needs some work.<br /><br />So is it better than the Cascade Fat Head II? No. Is it close? No not really its different but the Cascades are much brighter and cleaner. But that said it has a place and I am going to experiment with it to create a layered guitar sound. I had a Royer R-121 before. Is it even comparable? Again NO! Its a 100 dollar mic you just cant compare to manufacturing and design of a 1k plus mic. But that said its a great mic for the price. But I would tell you to spend 150-175 and get the Fat Heads. Better sound, better mounts (big time) and it comes with a case. For the price point those are a much better deal over all if you look at everything included. I just have some foam and a cardboard box for this guy.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hRorm6AAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hRorm6AAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hRorm6AAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B003PEBNHM,B003PEBNHM,AE2O73Q3TAFGWMDXU2PWWMLLJQGQ,1440894417000,2,True,2015-08-30 00:26:57.000

5.0,Great EQ overall,This is a great EQ pedal if you run it at 18v to get the lowest SNR.  I think some people just plug it into a 9v power source but that doesn't make it any better than the prior version of this pedal which i found noisey. I use it at the front end of the signal chain behind an Xotic compressor and a TU-3 (but would probably be best with nothing but a guitar and cable front of it). Remember that the Gain and Volume sliders are going to amplify whatever signal is entering so the 18v power supply is a must.  Some power supplies will let you combine two 9v outlets using a Y-barrel cable connector if you prefer the ditch the wall wart but I haven't tried it with this pedal.,[],B01MRSPOWU,B01MRSPOWU,AERT4HDY425N5KJTTCNWAERITT3A,1607004884179,0,False,2020-12-03 14:14:44.179

5.0,"Just like the non-wheeled version, but a little better designed.","I should start with the fact that I like the Pro-Tec Double Trumpet Case without wheels. But carrying two trumpets with other stuff attached to the bag (mute bag) is a little much.<br /><br />The case has pretty sturdy construction and a lot of pads that are trumpet length and can easily be moved for your best design of how they should fit. It also includes several (plenty) of little foam blocks to prop up the horns and keep them from butting against the lid when closed. It includes a velcro pocket for 2 mouthpieces. The front has a pouch for music that will fit the slim music folders that hold 8.5"" X 11"" pages of music, not the bigger folders. It is orientated so that the top of the pouch aligns with the short edge of the case, instead of the long edge. This is a big improvement over the non-wheeled version, and allows for much more storage. It also includes the famous Pro-Tec organizer for pens, pencils, business cards, etc..<br /><br />The wheels and pull handle are awesome, probably a little less than the Gard versions, but plenty sturdy and strong. I have had NO issues wheeling it over parking lots and hallways. It includes a shoulder strap, however, I won't be putting this thing on my shoulder any time soon. The zippers and velcro fasteners work just like the other Pro-Tec cases and the cord handles are good. It also features rings for you to fasten other items like a mute bag.<br /><br />It is not a huge bag, the non-wheeled version is flyable without checking it, but the wheels may make it too big for overhead storage on a plane. I would NOT check this bag when flying. Two trumpets fit perfectly and will probably not hold a tall cornet. Cornets with a small wrap may fit, but not if they are taller than a trumpet. It would probably hold a flugelhorn on its side, but not in combination with another instrument.<br /><br />This is not meant to be a hard case, therefore it is not as heavy as a traditional double case (ie: Bach), but that is probably why you are considering it in the first place. The wheels and pull handle make it a little heavy to put on your shoulder.<br /><br />If you are looking for a wheelie bag to carry two trumpets or one trumpet and a bunch of mutes, stand, mute holder, etc.., this is a great bag for it.",[],B004UEPU2K,B01H8682EY,AFSHP7B4Z2EDOWMMTC373D6AYZTA,1617798848313,3,True,2021-04-07 12:34:08.313

3.0,My experience with this guitar.,"The one I got has some high frets. The action at the nut was SKY HIGH. The overall string action came SKY HIGH. I had to put a new nut on it. They factory one looked like the filed it with a steak knife. Extreme string buzz from the 12th fret up due to the high frets. The red stain/paint is all over the white binding in places. The maple top on mine does not look nowhere near as good as the pictures. Was not playable out of the box. String action was so high you could drive a mac truck under it. It needs a fret leveling and crowning straight out of the box. Feels more like a $200 guitar rather than a $430 one. Sam Ash is who I got it from. They were nice and friendly in the messages. They didn't have another one I could exchange it with. The flame maple top looks just OK but not like the pictures. You have to really look hard and turn it in the light to see the flaming. Almost NO flaming on the headstock. I was committed in buying it and decided to keep it and fix it. If I had to buy it again knowing the shape it's in, I would not buy it. It does not feel or play like a $430 guitar at all. It's just OK at best. If it was $200 I'd say ""sure!! buy it"", but it's not worth what they are charging. You might get lucky and get a perfect one that looks exactly like the pics though.

You don't actually need to buy a Casio brand adapter to fit your Casio keyboard (matching model numbers can be tricky online). Here's a fool- proof method for finding the right adapter every time;<br /><br />On the back or underside of your keyboard, there should be a voltage rating (which looks like a number followed by 'V'. For example, '9V' or '8V') and a milliamp rating (which looks like a larger number followed by 'mA'. For example, '850mA' or '900mA').<br /><br />With those two numbers, you can find the exact adapter you need. :) For example, my keyboard is rated '9V 850mA', which looks like a bunch of gobbldeygook until you type it into a search engine or show it to a salesperson at any electronics or toy store. Almost all adapters are rated this way and regardless of the manufacturer (i.e. Casio, Yamaha), you'll always get the exact adapter you need when using voltage and milliamp numbers. Just be sure the other end of the adapter is the right fit for your input jack, and you're all set.""",[],B0002S079E,B0002S079E,AHEVTPYEU7EFCDSRETTDJN4BF5DA,1185601401000,32,False,2007-07-28 05:43:21.000

3.0,Fantastic Tone and Form Factor: But Caveat Emptor,"I bought this amp &#34;5&#34; separate times over the last 15 months looking for a good/quiet amp.

Also, as you can see, the combo turned sideways is a perfect match/fit for the SVT15E; and they sound pretty darn great together as well.  So, why the &#34;3&#34; stars?  Because I had to buy it FIVE TIMES to get one that wasn't unacceptably noisy (fan/high pitched white noise/effects loop squealing/etc)!  And Ampeg's response was always the same lame answer when I sent them sound clips: &#34;that's well within normal parameters.&#34;  And it was not.  So, if you get lucky and find one that got through the factories the right way, I could not recommend this combo amp any stronger-the best sounding combo for the price I've ever heard. But, caveat emptor: you may have to cycle through a few of them to make that happen.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YGqj7kqQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YGqj7kqQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YGqj7kqQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00IN2WFA0,B0787H2XHY,AHFTLBR2SWIHPZVEFU7TLYQBP2FQ,1494870974000,28,True,2017-05-15 17:56:14.000

5.0,You can't find a better DAW at any price!,"[UPDATE(1/23/17): Mixcraft Pro Studio 8 is now available with some great upgrades; this review applies pretty much equally to this new version.]<br />I am a professional music producer and Mixcraft Pro Studio 7 is my go-to DAW. It is the easiest to use and provides most every feature I need. This seventh version was recently released and comes in both 32 and 64 bit versions. It is loaded with improvements(but even the previous version was great!) and really blows the competition away! The improvements include new synths, presets, sampling software, a much improved help manual, and much more. Not only is this the best overall DAW on the market, but the price is among the lowest. Combine this with great tech support and you have an unbeatable tool. I have mentioned some suggestions to Mixcraft over the years which I wish they would include. In particular, there is only one feature not included which forces me to occasionally resort to Ableton: continuous transposition of audio files. It is an important tool in such applications as cinematic music. They could accomplish this by just supplying a transposing plugin and then it could even be used in automation. Even Ableton doesn't automate that feature. I should also mention that Mixcraft allows very easy use of plugins. Both the 32 and 64 bit versions will even recognize and utilize both 32 bit and 64 bit plugins. Even Ableton doesn't do that. So, if you are shopping around for a DAW and think there must be something wrong with this because it is so much less expensive than some other popular ones, I can assure you that is not the case. This is the best!<br />By the way, I notice in the description that it mentions 18 virtual instruments. That is an error. There are hundreds of virtual instruments! They might be referring to the number of underlying synths that are used to create various virtual instruments, but there are many, many virtual instruments from kotos, dulcimers, Irish bagpipes, pianos, guitars, banjos, timpani, glockenspiels, glass harmonicas, accordions, bassoons, oboes, and pretty much everything else!",[],B00SXZBLXE,B00SXZBLXE,AH4JE3MACJFT7QFNZYOR6VWCPRIQ,1426257846000,48,False,2015-03-13 14:44:06.000

2.0,Solid piece of hardware with crippling driver issue,"I've used this regularly for recording voiceover and livestreaming on my Windows 10 machine for two years now, and when it works, it's great.

I've had to deal with this problem and even end streams early due to this issue, creating unusuable segments in the video.

5.0,Beautiful Reverb,"Years ago, I had a BOSS RV3, and sold it when I was hard up for cash one day. It was a great pedal. Well, after years of missing it, I've finally decided to replace it. Technology has moved on since then, reverb pedals have come a long way. I didn't just settle on the RV6 without extensive research. I looked into all the standard options by EHX, TCE, DOD and others. I even looked into the Mooer Ocean Machine (I'm a huge Devin Townsend fan.) Really what it boiled down to is me already owning a bunch of BOSS pedals. The sound differences between the standalone reverb pedals wasn't big enough to sell me on any one over the other. Prices are all fairly similar.<br /><br />It arrived today, and I immediately hooked it up to my amp. I spent a good while cycling through all the different settings, and all (except shimmer) of them were good for what they are. Here are some brief thoughts:<br /><br />Modulate - I'll probably shift between this and Hall for my primary tones. This had a rich sounding character that I couldn't quite place, but quite enjoyed. This was one of my favorites.<br />Spring - Sounds pretty similar to the reverb on my Peavey Bandit 112 (which is also a digital reverb.) It works well enough for those who might want to capture a more surf-like sound.<br />Plate - This sounds metallic and rather shimmery to my ears (and I think it should.) Overall, this is a nice sounding reverb and I can see myself using it from time to time.<br />Hall - This really does give me the impression of being in a cavernous room like a church or concert hall. I have to watch it though... cranking up too much on any of the settings can send this one into the realms of uselessness. Keeping settings in check, however, make this one of my favs.<br />Room - Yep. Sounds like a room (probably the least useful for my tastes.)<br />Dynamic - This responds to how you pick. Lots of fun, and I can see it being useful for surreal applications.<br />Shimmer - This was a neat idea, but poorly executed, in my opinion. It adds a shifted pitch to the reverb, which didn't always seem to be in key with what I was playing. I don't see myself using this at all.<br />+Delay - This was the primary setting I used on the RV3, but I now have a DD7 and DM2w. I might find a situation where I'll want 3 delays, but now I'm content with just 2.<br /><br />Ultimately, I would highly recommend this pedal to anyone looking for a small-sized stomp box reverb solution.",[],B07DP8JVLS,B07DP8JVLS,AFHER2NWLJQHNQ4BRB4NZAG46VCQ,1548269453675,1,True,2019-01-23 18:50:53.675

4.0,It‚Äôs a hefty sturdy capo. One handed use is fine.,"The capo looks and feels fantastic. Not sure, why some reviews say they have difficulty using with one hand. It‚Äôs super simple to use with one hand. How to use: center the top pad with your strings and neck and squeeze the bottom portion towards the top with the top portion resting on the strings.<br />How NOT to use: especially with guitars with smaller neck profiles. Don‚Äôt butt-up the inside of the capo (the inner ‚ÄúC‚Äù) against the neck of the guitar. With the way the internal pad mechanism is designed to function, if it‚Äôs not centered with the guitar‚Äôs specific neck size and strings, it will not seal properly and cause buzzing as it‚Äôs off-center. If you align it like explained in ‚ÄúHow to use‚Äù it should seal properly with no buzzing.<br />As far as de-tuning, it does a better job than most. It beats having to adjust tension on the capos with the turning tension mechanism when switching guitars. So far, no capo is perfect. This is pretty close. Can‚Äôt wait for the next iteration!

5.0,"Excellent Starter Set For Learning Guitar, Even For Some Adults","I have been playing guitar since I was young.  One thing that I appreciated was the option to learn on a classical guitar vs acoustic.  It is an important step and helped me a lot to learn the chords and fingering without splitting my finger tips in the process.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />GUITAR QUALITY<br />The guitar quality is surprisingly good.  The action is nice, the neck is equally spaced between the strings all of the way up.  The frets are manageable by smaller fingers or people developing the reach.<br /><br />SOUND<br />The sound of this is very nice.  It gives satisfaction for a beginner to make it sound like it is special instead of a dead or clunky sound like some beginning instruments have a tendency to deliver.  It has a decent resonance which is rewarding.<br /><br />STRINGS<br />The strings are all decent. They have pretty good feel to them and are easier to press than steel strings, especially for kids or beginners who are tender in their finger tips.  When you get this, be sure to pull the strings out a bit gently and then retune it a few times.  That will break them in well so they don't take a week to settle in.<br /><br />CASE<br />The case is a gig bag (soft not hardened) and it does not have padding in it.  There is a pocket to store your extra parts and music if needed.  One thing I want to mention here is that gig bags have a history of problems due to the zippers not being secured properly.  Often the zippers come apart as soon as you open it.<br /><br />This case, however, is very well made.  Each end of the zipper is sewn down so there is not the problem of it coming apart easily.  This is a big deal, trust me.  I have worked with a lot of annoying cases where I forget to check and before I know it the zipper falls apart making the case useless unless I can fix it.<br /><br />TUNER<br />The tuner works well and is great to tune with especially as you begin to acquire the ability to tell when it is in tune by ear eventually.<br /><br />PICKS<br />Usually picks are not used with classical, but sometimes they are.  These picks are pretty standard.<br /><br />STRAP<br />The strap has instructions on this page so be sure to come back and learn how to attach it to the guitar.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For the price, this is an excellent beginner's guitar for either kids or adults who want to learn but don't have the money to invest in an expensive guitar.  It will help you learn the basics, develop small callouses on your fingers, and get your guitar playing off to a great start.  It comes with what you need to get started.<br /><br />RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a pretty decent guitar and I do recommend it especially if you are not sure the student in question REALLY will pursue guitar and you want a decent instrument that won't break the bank.",[],B08LVW75N5,B08LVW75N5,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,1612906519401,0,False,2021-02-09 21:35:19.401

But with the fog chiller, the fog swirled along the ground for several minutes before dissipating. This has been my only experience with this unit thus far, but so far so good!

I took the pipe apart to see if there was anything stuck in the reeds and there was nothing obvious to indicate why the reeds wouldn't vibrate, so it has to be a problem with the manufacturing of the reed. You have to blow super hard to get any sound out, and when you do, it causes the pitch to come out flat before scooping up to its intended pitch, which again is about 30 cents sharp.

4.0,"A great piece of hardware/software, very portable and easy to use","Nice DJ controller with a lot of features for the price<br /><br />When I first received this controller I was a little surprised by the size of it...smaller than I expected. This may be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your preferences or needs. It's just probably not going to be too 'impressive' looking at your next event. It's nice that it is USB powered, no separate power supply needed. Overall the unit feels solid, but some of the controls feel a little flimsy, namely the A/B slider and the scratch pads. One complaint I have is that the device does not have any 'overall' illumination...yes, buttons light up when activated, but working this deck in the dark might be problematic. The buttons and most controls feel solid and have nice feedback. All controls are very responsive with no latency from the deck or the app.<br /><br />Software installation had a few glitches but it eventually finished up and after a few updates the deck was recognized and all was good. Time to start mixing and scratching...<br /><br />I am not an experienced DJ. Having no real experience with this sort of thing I wasn't sure what to expect. It took me about an hour or so to get the hang of it and then it was a lot of fun to mix tracks and add effects. It was nice to be able to 'preview' the upcoming transition and prepare it accordingly.<br />The DJuced software has some nice features too, including the ability to analyze the BPM of all the tracks in your collection. Then you can, if you wish, sort your tracks according to BPM to aid in the transitions. The 'Sync' feature is great, it will automatically adjust the B track's pitch to line up with the currently playing A track for smooth mixes. The 3-band equalizer is a nice addition. And let's not forget the effects, looping and sampling features, those are fantastic.<br /><br />This is a nice deck with a lot of features, but it is dependent on having a computer with you, it does not function stand-alone. I did find file navigation in the PC app to be a bit cumbersome, with not much room on the screen for file and folder lists...this could be due to my screen's small size and resolution though(1366x768).<br /><br />There was one thing I wanted it to do that I could not figure out how to do. I wanted to be able to prepare the upcoming transition, identify the point in the 'A' track at which the 'B' track would start playing, and then have it happen automatically. But it doesn't seem to do this(or at least I never figured it out). Which means that when the A track is ending and it's time to start the B track, I would have to be there and be ready at the controls. Maybe I just missed that setting somewhere.<br /><br />Overall it's a great piece of hardware/software, very portable and easy to use.

3.0,Feels cheap. Snapped a screw. Although works fine.,"I bought this because i have another source audio pedal that can use the hot hand as a control, so i can technically control 3 pedals with it. I figured this pedal would be built well for the money. i also figured the 4 extra screws with the tapered heads were for if you wanted this on a pedalboard and had to remove the feet. As the back plate is also tapered under the feet. Upon trying to do so, the first one snapped in half, and is stuck in the body of the pedal. I had to drill out the other 3 screw holes to actually let the screw become flush with the cover without snapping. theyre tiny screws and are very easy to snap. Very easy. I know expression pedals arent complex circuit wise, its literally just 2 potentiometers to a trs jack. even with the hot hand thing it looks very minimal on the inside. so i guess i was hoping for the money the build quality would be a bit better... its much lighter than my wah pedal thats the same size. Its also not as smooth as the wah. all that being said it does work fine as an expression pedal, both 1/4 jacks and the hot hand jack. Still miffed you have to countersink the screw holes.

For about a year I have been making my decision.  I finally ordered the amp on Wednesday around 3:30 PM.  Around 10:45 AM the amp had been delivered.  I was not expecting it for another week or so.  Much to my surprise it was sent from Andy's Music in Mobile, Alabama.  I live about 300 miles north in Alabama.  I was so excited at how quickly I received the amp.

Got a partial refund, but had to deal with fender and get the run around, taking it to a local tech for inspection and having them ship a replacement. The replacement was slightly better, but had a large chip out of the poly clear coat on the headstock and dips in a few spots on the neck. Fender agreed to have me send the guitar to them directly and they would have another fully inspected by a manager before it was sent out to me. 3rd time was the charm, sort of. No issues with the body, pickups or neck from what I can tell, but there were several spots that looked like long scratches that ended up being some adhesive substance that was able to be cleaned away using a guitar mist and wipe cleaner.

5.0,Great instrument!,"I'm only starting to explore the Jammy guitar and everything it has to offer. Mostly, messing around with the mobile app now. Also, checking out all the backing tracks, tunings, and effects pedals..<br /><br />My favorite part so far is the FX section. Those pedals look just like the real ones! Each effect has a variety of settings so you can fine-tune them, which is a nice plus. Noteworthy that you can only put effects in a chain in the 'correct' order: Comp, Wah, Distortion, EQ, Modulation, Delay, and Reverb.<br /><br />What struck me most about the Jammy is that doesn't forgive sloppy fingering. On the other hand, this constraint forces you to play cleaner, which is a good thing<br /><br />It's a digital instrument, so it doesn't have this 'warm tube feeling' to it.

2.0,Interesting instrument with a couple of flaws,"This ukulele is an interesting piece of equipment. I'd call it generally good, but marred by some irritating flaws.<br /><br />I'm comparing this with three other ukuleles: a typical $80 Lanikai concert, a pro-quality Pono tenor, and a $25 kids'-toy-grade soprano.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Construction is quite nice. It's comfortably sized as a concert, and the solid-body design allows it to be nice and flat - very pleasant size and shape for playing. After playing this, acoustic ukes feel a little bulky. The heft is also solid enough to feel substantial but not heavy.<br /><br />* The controls on the front are easy to use.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* The black styling overly shiny for my tastes - at first glance, you might mistake it for cheap-electronics plastic. It also picks up fingerprints and smudges like crazy. A matte finish might've been much more appropriate.<br /><br />* The one I received feels a bit out of tune. Ukes typically go through a setup process before shipping... I rather doubt that this one did, but maybe not to be expected from a $200 uke. There's no way to adjust the action, so you're kind of stuck with it.<br /><br />* The strings look nice (jet-black, nice complement to the body) and feel OK to play. But when you start playing it, they're *incredibly* squeaky. I don't know how else to describe it. I typically play on Aquila nylgut or super nylgut and don't have this problem, so maybe it's the material type. Regardless, it's a big distraction while playing. If I were to keep this one, I'd have to change out the strings almost immediately. (And I think that electric ukes require special strings, so that may be a problem.)<br /><br />* The internal amp for the headphones jack has a fair amount of white noise (&#34;hiss&#34;) when the volume is set to a reasonable level. Sure, you can't expect much from an internal amp powered by a 9V battery, but still.<br /><br />Major Flaw:<br /><br />The uke has three ports - a 1/2&#34; TRS jack for an amp, a 1/4&#34; TRS &#34;headphones&#34; jack (appropriately sized for corded headphones), and an &#34;MP3&#34; jack, which I presume is line-in. But here's a major design problem: the latter two jacks are centered on the back of the uke. If you plug anything into either jack, the plug will poke you square in the abdomen while you try to play it. This is insanely irritating - it makes the uke practically unusable. At the very least, you'll need an elbow connector to send the cords off in a different direction - which not only requires additional gear, but can introduce line problems.<br /><br />I have no idea why they made this choice. The 1/2&#34; TRS jack (which can't be used for headphones, as it's not amplified by the battery) is in the usual position on the bottom - why they couldn't position the other two ports right next to it is beyond me.<br /><br />As such, this uke is uncomfortable to play. Coupled with the other problems, it's a poor choice for an instrument - especially since other solid-body electric ukes are available that don't have these problems.",[],B005RA3SZM,B012GW0DM4,AEMHDYWLQ6TVXL36QTSXOSKITQNQ,1502143554844,3,True,2017-08-07 22:05:54.844

1.0,Poor QA,"I bought one of these DACs after careful review of many DACs to add to my collection of high-end DA-Converters. For reference, I currently own 2 Chord Hugo M Scalers, 1 Chord Hugo TT2, 1 Chord Qutest, 1 Topping D90SE, 1 FiiO K9 Pro, 1 Questyle CMA Fifteen, iFi NEO iDSD, and several ""entry level"" DACs such as the Zen series from iFi, FiiO K5 Pro and portables from FiiO, CEntrance, and Chord. I preface with what I currently own to demonstrate that I do not lack familiarity handling and purchasing delicate and expensive pieces of audio equipment.<br /><br />Looking for a DAC to use as part of my entertainment system (hook up to my AVR), I wanted something that could compete with my Hugo TT2 that was at the time processing music audio before hitting my AVR. This DAC from Synthax (the parent company) looked and sounded from reviews like it would fit the bill!! So I purchased it from a retailer I had some store credit with. Well, nightmare begins.<br /><br />Upon arrival, the DAC would not power on. I tried several times to power the unit on using the supplied power cord, but to no prevail. Thinking to myself that perhaps the power cord was defective, I used a different power cord that I own from the brand iFi. The unit still didn't power on. I emailed the retailer and told them about the DOA unit and the unit not turning on using either the supplied power cord or a different cord, therefore indicating something is wrong with the unit. They requested a serial number to confirm the unit is the same unit they sent me and upon confirmation provided me with a shipping label to send it back to them.<br /><br />Upon receipt of the unit back in February, I was informed that the manufacturer of the RME ADI2DACFS would not authorize a refund or exchange until they examined the unit to determine whether I caused damage to the unit by using a different power cord. Despite it not powering on upon unboxing the unit, they ignore this fact and refuse to honor my word. It is almost May and the unit still hasn't been ""examined"". I have not been refunded, given a new unit, nor have I been given regular updates. I have been threatened to be sent to collections if I initiate a chargeback with my credit card company. I have been threatened to be charged a repair fee ""when [they] find that [I] caused the unit to not operate.""<br /><br />I cannot recommend anyone purchase this product as the company does not stand by the quality of their product and will resort to using red herring arguments to avoid taking responsibility for their quality assurance problems. As of right now, I am still out over $1300, not including tax, waiting for the manufacturer of this DAC to inevitably ""find"" me responsible for damaging the DAC despite it arriving DOA.<br /><br />This is, without speaking in hyperbole, the worst customer service experience I have ever had.

5.0,"I hate buying Chinese, but................","I received the Violent Metal a couple of weeks ago and I am very pleased with it.  It's got a great overall grind (i.e, nature of the distortion).  As someone else said, it sounds kinda organic and  natural, or tonally pleasing.  Also, it's got alot of volume on tap.<br /><br />What really impresses me about it is the usefullness of the mid eq.  With other shred boxes that I've owned or own, they seem to only shine with the mids backed off; with the mids cranked most get a bit unnatural sounding to me. With the VM, I can get sweet tones by either boosting the mids or cutting them.  It's just very musical sounding to me.  It does have a bit of noise at extreme gain settings, but no more than other high gain boxes I've played.  I'm not a metal player, more of a 70's progressive rock guy, but I love metal and try to mess around with that style for fun and to improve my picking speed.

4.0,Better than Gecko model kalimba!,"This kalimba fulfills my expectations. I first ordered a Gecko model that was shown in the display pictures as having engraved keys. It didn't. I returned it and bought this Moozica instead. This one seems heavier, better made and I like the curved indented front. My hands feel more comfortable. These tynes are engraved, just like I wanted. I can't say it was in tune when it arrived but I only spent a few minutes using the app to tune it up. It sounds good. The hard case is not the same quality as the Gecko case but that's not real important to me. I'm a senior, I wanted something to keep my mind and hands busy during the pandemic. I have no intentions of playing it anywhere but home! I like the sound of this kalimba better than the Gecko model. This kalimba sounds abit deeper, not so tinny. This comes with a little gold chain that fastens to the front but it's cheap. I don't/won't use it. For the money I paid, this was well worth it. I don't know if professionals buy their musical instruments on Amazon but for the average customer like me, this kalimba works well. One high key, E3 doesn't sound right and I'm having some trouble getting it to hold it's pitch. I thought I should mention that but all the other keys are smack in tune. It's not a note I use alot and it's not worth returning the  product. This is the closest instrument to a piano I've found that's small and portable. That's the biggest appeal of the kalimba! I can play songs on this just like a small piano.

5.0,Great Guitar,"First let me say that this is a $300 guitar, its a budget guitar. However, don't let that fool you. It has a thinner neck than Fenders but a little thicker than Jacksons but is very comfortable. If you know how to set it up it stays in tune very well though the intonation is a little off (I have been too lazy to fix it but it can be done). The neck pickup is a little mid-rangey and the bridge doesn't have quite enough gain for me but it still has a lot. Oh and the picture does this guitar no justice at all. VERY beautiful finish with the black flamed maple top. Just be careful not to over-tighten the string lock down screws or the nut lock screws or they strip out. I've replaced them so its fine now.

3.0,Nice cheap upgrade from onboard audio,"Contrary to what some think, this does work with Win7 x64 unless I just have an updated version. It will work as a WDM or MME device using the default Win7 drivers and shows up as a USB audio device. I'm using Cakewalk Sonar 8.5 PE so I didn't bother installing Cubase but the following method should work just the same if you want the better ASIO mode.<br /><br />First google the asio4all driver and install the latest which was the 2.10 beta version at this time. Plug the Alpha in, it will say error but that is probably just the missing Lexicon ASIO driver. Once that installs, go to the Windows sound device panel and set the USB audio device as the default for playback and recording. If the USB audio device doesn't show yet, unplug the Alpha then plug it back in or restart.<br /><br />Now when you start a program that can use ASIO mode, the asio4all icon will show in the system tray and you can set which devices to use. Adjust the ASIO buffer size if there is any crackle in the playback caused from missing data. I was able to get half the latency compared to the Lexicon driver running in XP so I wouldn't even bother using their driver even when they finally update it.<br /><br />As for the actual device, it's very solid and has a clean sound with low latency (30-60ms). The base is metal and the top is plastic but an industrial strength. There isn't really much of a choice in this price range for 24bit 48Khz so I consider this a good replacement for default on board sound more than anything. It's nice to have the monitor mix to have 0 latency when needed then switch back to standard playback. One thing I don't like is that the output level is linked to both the headphone and line out so you can't adjust them independently.<br /><br />I'm pleased with it and give it 5 stars for myself but 3 stars for regular people. It can't really be recommended simply because of the extra steps needed for Win7 x64 which is becoming the default Windows install.",[],B000HVXMNE,B077Z9HF27,AHUDHS3JWYA7QZSJAFBIVQ4HYVRQ,1264301402000,37,False,2010-01-24 02:50:02.000

5.0,"So Far, So Good...","My Amazon Basic Microphone arrived this morning and I jumped right in.  First, it was packaged well, both inside and out.  The ""inside"" packaging makes a nice storage box when you remove the inner dividers.  The microphone seems to be just as heavy and professional grade as any competing brand.<br /><br />The provided XLR cable is closer to medium duty than professional grade, but it's there, it's long and at no extra cost.  The same can be said of the on/off switch, not professional grade but good...and it's there (you have to pay extra with some competing brands/models).  The provided mic stand adapter appears to be of good quality and it attached easily and securely to both the stand and the microphone.<br /><br />I jacked it into my ""Mississippi Marshall"" - - a Peavey 2x12 tube combo amp - - 'with all EQ's at noon'.  The volume was audible but by no means overwhelming.  I turned the channel gain up to about 8 or 9 and then 'it will blow you out of the water'.  As an extremely deaf former rock drummer that can't carry a tune in a bushel basket, I cannot speak to the clarity or responsiveness of the mic but it sounded more than okay to my tone-deaf ears.  Feedback was minimal only when the mic was facing directly into the amp at close distances (maybe four to six feet).  Proper placement of amps/speakers/monitors should provide ample control of feedback.<br /><br />If you're looking for a top quality home recording microphone this probably isn't it, but for a performance microphone for jamming, karaoke or informal gigs, that doesn't require a second mortgage to finance, look no further.",[],B07MJKKS5T,B09QBYTMYN,AERNWK3CEGQBNNZZ7467HKXCYJSA,1567613516650,3,True,2019-09-04 16:11:56.650

A steal at that price as it's the cheapest reliable recorder I could find online at that time. I think that I would normally have to pay more for it. After playing it, I think I probably would.<br /><br />The instrument is exactly what I'd expect from Aulos. It plays clearly and easily throughout the entire range of the instrument. It is sturdy and well made and came with all the usual bits and pieces (fingering chart, cleaning rod, a nice drawstring case and an attachable thumb rest). Aulos has excellent quality control. At least, in my experience. The instrument plays exactly like my other preferred Aulos model, the 303AE. Heck, it probably is the same instrument just with a different model number for some reason.<br /><br />My only beef with the instrument is the ugly ""cream"" color that for some reason recorder makers think is so popular.

5.0,but it is fine for my uses and there is no latency issue ...,"In the hunt for a new i/o box,  I discovered Antelope Audio.<br /><br />After researching the PURE 2 ,  reading reviews ,  seeing the specs, i pulled the trigger on this.  I use it as an I/O .....but it can also print superb master tracks.  The clarity that results from the rubidium clocking and the very high grade AD/DA conversion was stunning from the moment I fired it up and tested it out.  For those who need many inputs,  this is not your solution as an I/O, but it  certainly is for mastering or AD/DA conversion.  But,  if you are a VST user,  and or compose for project oriented video, commercial, and movie, this may be what you have always wanted though you may never have known.<br /><br />i was skeptical about the usb connection,  but it is fine for my uses and there is no latency issue whatsoever.<br /><br />The clocking alone improves the stereo imaging dramatically ,  also it improves the clarity of the the high and low shelves.  The AD/DA converters also aid in this incredible clarity. That is to say that realism for VST sample libraries is greatly increased. So,  perhaps it may breath new life into aspects of your sound pallet that you previously thought were &#34;cheesy&#34; or just plain bad (unless they are just cheesy and plain bad).  Using Vienna Sounds,  East/west products, 8DIo, Native instruments, and other notable libraries,  i found a whole new realm of sonic fidelity unlocked by this PURE 2.<br /><br />2300 bucks seems like a lot,  but this thing is the best deal for the money out there,  to arrive at comparable sound quality ,  clocking and AD/DA conversion, you would have to spend 6 grand to come close,  and would have to buy an AD/DA converter,  buy a clock,  and an I/O,  which for comparable quality would put you in the ballpark of spending upwards of 10 grand..  Pure 2 is the best deal out there.<br /><br />I love this thing,  get one if you can!

Sure, they are better quality, but that doesn't make the Snowball bad by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />Using the Snowball for local recording and broadcasting via voice chat applications has been perfect. From a high end gaming headset with mic in the absolute best of conditions, it still compares not in the least to the Blue in merely okay conditions. The cardioid setting is perfect for those in a somewhat noisy environment.<br /><br />If you're considering a great consumer level microphone to give you the best of your expectations when gaming, podcasting, recording your chat, or more, then this is an easy purchase. Especially if you have an Amazon Prime account, there's no difficult deciding. While I may have been hesitant at first on whether or not to pick this up or spend the extra on the Yeti, my choice has not let me down.",[],B002OO18NS,B09G9DVTD3,AEIUGU6CVC7QMTO5VYTIGKJ3ZQBA,1379075464000,1,True,2013-09-13 12:31:04.000

The recorded audio is high quality and will meet the needs for most people. There is definite noise when recording, but does not take away from the overall quality of the audio and for this price, it should be expected. For a budget wireless mic set, it is excellent. The main issue I have with this mic set is the limited information about the gain setting on the mic transmitter. Some type of a light indicator would be helpful. However, there are just a plus and and minus buttons, so you have no idea what the gain level is. The only way to tell is to check on the display of your camera/device or to do a live test the audio, which could take a little time to figure out.

1.0,"You want honesty, here it is. UPDATE: 3 weeks after buying, 2 pads have stopped functioning correctly.","DM10.<br /><br />Update: As if I needed another reason to not like this kit. The kick pad earlier this week was spontaneously missing hits, it seemed to have stopped, only to be replaced my the snare pad today having the same issue. I cannot possibly stress how unsatisfied I am with both this kit itself, and it's embarrassingly tech support. Save your money and look elsewhere.****<br /><br />Went with this set for a few reasons. I began with a Roland TD1K, absolute base model. Added a mesh snare. Used the same software I am now. Superior Drummer 2.0. Never had an issue. I wanted a new set because I wanted all mesh pads, dual zone toms, a real kick mechanism, and a three zone ride. This kit is supposed to give you all of them. I have spent very little time using the onboard sounds, other reviewers have commented that they are lackluster and I agree. I went with this set because I just didn't want to spend the extra $600 for the TD-11KV. Mostly because I'm just not all that skilled, and I couldn't see myself dishing out the extra cash for a premium instrument when I'm not now, and probably never will be a premium drummer. I saw this on a popular used gear site for $300 less than retail, but still unopened due to a store closure and thought I was golden. Mistake.<br /><br />Got the set in the mail. After reading around 50+ reviews due to my excitement I knew I'd have to update the module with new trigger information as well as sound info. Did that, AFTER using a third party to get a windows 10 driver because it isn't available on the Alesis website. I mentioned before that I'm not a great drummer, what I am extremely good at is computers, midi, and other such tech matters. Were it not for that. This set would be unusable. Below are the reasons for my distaste. Read on...<br /><br />1. Plugging this into a VST is a nightmare. Upon plugging in and updating firmware. I'm hit with cross talk. Just kidding. This isn't crosstalk. Crosstalk is caused by vibration moving through the rack and triggering other drums. This is caused by Alesis' blatant disregard for the standard midi out information using an ekit. Even AFTER choosing the Alesis edrum preset available in EZDrummer 2 and SD2, this problem remains. Tom 4 sounds a crash. Hat controller sounds a crash. Choking the ride sounds Tom 4 and a crash. This luckily, was fixable to a degree. Using SD2 I was able to remap the pads, though every time I switch to a different preset the settings revert and I'm left with an unusable kit. This leads to issue 2.<br />2. If you are unfortunate enough to only have EZDRUMMER, you cannot use this kit to its full capacity. You cannot remap sounds and therefor this gear is nothing more than a paperweight to you. I feel horrible for you if this is your situation.<br />3. The larger pads I paid extra for are 2 inches larger than the standard. Nearly ALL of this extra space is dead, and does not trigger any midi out action when hit. This is the case for the 12' snare and toms as well as the 10's.<br />4. After 3 weeks of tinkering I still only have what feels like a 1 zone ride. Choke doesn't work, nor does the bell and bow separation. Before you state, I have checked, and rechecked my cabling and it is flawless. I have even substituted my own TRS cables in to no avail. Thinking this was my fault, and this is the final straw and reason for my review... I switched back to the onboard sounds expecting the ride to work, yet the problem remains. I became curious if maybe my trigger sensitivities are just off so I factory wiped the module, plug in, STILL doesn't work. Maybe I have a bad cymbal. Maybe this set is junk.<br /><br />All in all. I regret buying this set. I cannot return it. And my old set was far less problematic and gave me the sense that I spent money for a good product. This however, feels like a toy. A beautiful looking toy. I've tried to love it. But I just can't. There are too many flaws. Just save your money and finance the Roland. Yamaha I've heard isn't bad at all either.<br /><br />Wish I could recommend and love this.

1.0,Absolutely terrible.,"I've been using Amazon for 20 years and this will be only the second product I've ever returned. After getting this put together, it's so flimsy that it's absolutely useless; the back rest for your guitar necks isn't stable and it tilts forward no matter how you attach the nuts and bolt to hold it to the base, so if you had multiple guitars sitting on it you'd knock them all over on the floor if you aren't *really* careful picking one up off the stand. I tried it with three different guitars with different body types, and none of them sat on it in a way that I felt safe leaving them there... even the slightest bump on the back of the neck rest would fold it forward and dump them all on the ground.<br /><br />It's rare that a product makes me angry enough to write a bad review for it, but this thing managed it.

I was able to flip through the various other instruments (as advertised) and eventually tune the G-D-A strings. But that was across many settings in the tuner. Alas, no C-string tuning here!

5.0,Great Mic For a Solo Artist,"I added this microphone to my extensive collection. I have  a lot of classic mics that I've collected since the 80's. I wanted to try a modeling mic but wanted a small one for my desk. I did not need a multipattern mic at my desk and that might influence your buying choices. This one fit the bill, I have it mounted on a scissor type radio desk mount at my desk for quick access. I find this mic is very clear and stands out when I'm tracking my voice. I use the classic mic models for processing when I'm mixing. On my voice [I'm a baritone] I don't notice the models so much in solo but they do make a HUGE difference in the mix. I've been experimenting with an all virtual studio. I'm a multi-instrumentalist, a producer/engineer with an extensive discography and mostly due to the covid epidemic, I have been unable to build yet another studio.<br />If I had one criticism I would like to see Antelope include a more effective pop filter with this mic.<br />I've had this mic for over a year as of this writing and I have had zero problems. I have used this mic on a solo project and this one has become my favorite and I've replaced all of the other tracks where I've used other mics. I do turn the phantom power off when I'm not using the mic and though it stays on the stand on my desk, it stays covered when not in use.

5.0,Great Mic.,"Features: Full Bandwidth, Sensitive, Low Noise, Uni and Omni Patterns, Mute, Stereo Headset Output with Volume control, solid metal housing.<br /><br />This mic is so good. You can yell at it and not overdrive the diaphragm, and yet, it is crystal clear.<br /><br />It is also easy to mount on a boom arm even though there are no instructions for it. You just take the screw from the base, slip it through the boom clamp after removing the 1/4"" ring on the boom, and then screw the mic back into the screw. It's not an official method but it works like a charm. I let mine hang upside down. That is my own method, but if you have the standard boom equipped for mounting a microphone, this mic has the standard thread base for the traditional mounting.<br /><br />I am sad  that this mic was undiscovered and was not showcased among the microphone testing crowd. It really is that good. I like the unidirectional pattern because it is not narrow like some of my other microphones. A super unidirectional mic has its place, but requires you never turn your head. This mic has a nice balance which allows me to set the mic 18"" away and come in clear and loud even if I turn my head in a 180 pattern. If I want more rejection, I just turn down the gain and get closer to the mic. It's perfectly controllable. Also, there is an omni (360) pattern. So if I want to record several people in the room, I just swing the mic to the middle and set omni on the push button.<br /><br />I have many microphones of various quality and I know a good one. You could use this mic to record a live band, a solo artist, make great sounding podcasts, Skype, you name it. Everyone I call on Skype says my audio quality went from good to extremely good. I genuinely feel sorry for people who missed out on this gem. And the company is a very good company.<br /><br />When I saw the closeout for this mic at $9, I picked up two more. It's so sad when something great slips by in obscurity. Oh well, you can always get yourself one of those mics that need to be nearly up your nose to get pickup and when you do your podcast, 25% of your face is covered.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716FHLB0CCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716FHLB0CCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716FHLB0CCL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EFoxAJ98L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EFoxAJ98L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EFoxAJ98L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GIEWxj+-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GIEWxj+-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GIEWxj+-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wqQc35f0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wqQc35f0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wqQc35f0L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0711R6WHP,B0711R6WHP,AG7AGXUWYZBBD6OU55Z72E3TYORA,1578515237581,0,True,2020-01-08 20:27:17.581

4.0,nice pick-up and EQ on the cheap.,"I bought 2 of these from C.B. Gitty due to the extremely low price. I was blown away by the fact that they arrived 2 days after I placed the order!. I decided to install the first one in my Mitchell 6 string before attempting the Fender 12 string.<br /><br />It didn't take long to get it in but I will say that if you aren't used to working on guitars then let an experienced luthier do the work. I used a dremmel tool and a file to cut the hole for the preamp/EQ unit after matching the curve of the unit to the curve of the body of the guitar. It didn't match exactly but the foam gasket on the unit helped to even out the difference. As mentioned in another review, there is no template but the instructions have dimensions for the hole....cut it on the smaller side then use a file to open it up to fit the amp.<br /><br />The biggest problem I encountered was in installing the pickup under the saddle. The groove in the bridge of my Mitchell was cut pretty shallow and after drilling the hole in the bridge for the pickup I discovered that the hole needed to be deepened the depth of the pickup or the saddle wouldn't be stable. (I was hoping to just file the saddle). This is a Major Pain In The Arse to do without the proper tools  without widening the groove in the bridge and making the saddle unstable.<br /><br />Anyway back to the actual review... The preamp works great but my saddle still needs a little adjustment.

5.0,Product Quality and Amazon Service Both Beyond Exceptional,"I mean to make this review as concise and direct as possible, so as to assist those who may be where I once was: relying on tons of good review and videos to determine whether this product will or will not be satisfactory.  This purchase has laid me witness, not only to the exceptional quality of the product, but to the services provided by Amazon that I would have rated more than five stars if I had the choice.  I use this preamble to simply give credit where it is most notably due.  Thank you Amazon.<br /><br />Build Quality:  Like a tank.  There are no exposed wires.  The padding is well stitched, almost totally hidden.  The pads are durable.  Adjustment is plastic but very thick and contains graduated notches.<br /><br />Comfort:  You will know that they are there.  The clamping force on the pair in the new state is somewhat large.  You will feel it holding on to your head, and to some people this may cause some discomfort.  The pads are designed to fit quite snugly and the drivers sit closely to your ears.  As a result the sound is unimaginably fantastic, but the tight fit, aside from isolating well, can also make the ears aware that they are not the only things chillin' on the side of your head.  I find that there is no discomfort and although the fit is tight at first, I have gotten used to it, and once I'm not hanging upside down, I forget that they are there.  Over hours of wearing though, I might need to move the arch to a different location on the top of my head.  Overall, I would say that its a bit like underwear, it fits snugly, but it moves comfortably with your features.<br /><br />Sound Quality:  There are few words to accurately describe.  They make you love that you were ever given the ability to perceive sound.  They make you hear things that you would have never thought existed in audio clips.  The best way to describe it, is with being close to the large drivers, well isolated, and having one of the largest frequency response ranges I've seen, its like being put in a totally dark room full of stuff.  Other pairs of headphones are like flashlights, they allow you to see some stuff at a time.  These cans flip the light switch on, and you can see everything in the room all at once.<br /><br />As a final remark on the product, Audio Technica continues to uphold its excellence in sound and with this pair of headphones.  They are built very well, I still have no words except those which were used above to help me help you figure out how good they actually sound.  They don't disappear when they're on, but they fit well, and may be tight at first.  They are an overall exceptional pair of headphones and I would recommend them to pretty much anyone, except someone who is extremely particular about monitoring and requires very expensive thousand dollar equipment.  I would also steer those who would like to spend the least that they can to get something that puts sound into their ears away from this high quality product.<br /><br />I selected standard shipping from amazon after purchasing within the final week of February.  I was told that it was estimated to arrive between the 11th and 18th of March.  When it was shipped, it said that it was then estimated to arrive on the 7th of March.  It actually arrived on the 5th.  Just as a testament to the excellent shipping care provided by Amazon.  Finally, when it arrived, it was well sealed.  The product was in original packaging, crisp and scratch free, better than I had pictured it, better than on the shelf in a store.  Not one flaw.<br /><br />Thank you for reading and I hope you find what you're looking for.  I also hope this has helped.<br />To Amazon, I appreciate being able to write this review.

If you need to record live music, this is the answer.<br /><br />Using it's built-in mics, the R-09 does an excellent job of capturing sound with excellent fidelity. To best them, you'll have to purchase a mic valued at $200 or more.<br /><br />The controls are simple, obvious, and straightforward. If you spend a few minutes acquainting yourself with them before recording, you shouldn't run into any problems even the first time you use the device.<br /><br />I find that I get the best results with near-field recording. When recording piano, for example, I place the R-09 over the keyboard, either suspended by a tripod or lying on a felt cloth. When recording voice, I get fantastic results with the R-09 placed 2-3 feet from the vocalist. And if recording a band, placing the R-09 on a tripod at ear level in the center of the group or in the front row center provides excellent results.<br /><br />While only a 2GB SD card is the specified maximum capacity, I have found standard - not SDHD - 4 GB SD cards can sometimes work. Good luck, though.

5.0,The best travel acoustic guitar,"&lt;&lt;See update below>><br /><br />I have had both Washburn Rover (this transparent red in steel string, and the nylon one in natural), for a couple years now and they are a joy to have for travel and to play. The neck is perfectly finished, smooth satin feel on the back, no fret sprout, binding all around, tuners that hold well, a truss-rod adjustable neck, a short-but-not-too-short scale of 24"", plus something its main competitor - the Martin Backpacker - doesn't have - a highly protective rigid foam travel case which, if necessary, allows you to safely gate-check the guitar if there's no room in an airplane's overhead bins. I have almost always found room, though - once, on top of a dreadnought in a hardcase. Case measures 35""x10""x5"" and has an accessory compartment and small outside pocket.<br /><br />Actually the Martin might not have a truss rod either. Nor can you hold it on your leg. Nor is the neck smooth like satin. Nor is access to the upper frets as good. But hey, it's a Martin, right, so it's got to be better, right? As Mike Lafontaine said, ""I don't THINK so!""<br /><br />Because the body/sound chamber is so much smaller than a dreadnought, you cannot expect the Rover to sound like a dreadnought. However, it doesn't sound like a banjo or ukelele either - it has a unique sound which seems to (pleasantly) be a blend of all. So it is particularly good for folk music, but even classical sounds pretty cool on it - and even on the steel string one (not unlike how a harpsichord sounds vs. a piano). Even though it's physically small, this is no silent guitar. Think of how loud a violin can get - being small is no guarantor of low volume. The Rover is not much quieter than a dreadnought; the main difference is in the texture of the sound, and it's obviously not as deep in the bass department.<br /><br />I have found that the curve of the body is just enough to play in classical position, angling the neck up by leaning the body against my left thigh and bracing it there with my right. I've also tried the Neckup guitar support, but over time, I've come to prefer either using the strap or bracing it as described.<br /><br />The case is wonderful for travel, but mine came with a bad smell that took a very long time to dissipate (over a year). I'm pretty sure it came from the plasticized rubber sliders on the case straps. I store the Rovers hanging up rather than in their cases, so I only use the cases for travel.<br /><br />A parlor-sized guitar might be easier to play in typical folk position (on the right leg for right-handers) but nothing is easier to travel with than the Rover, thanks to its case. Its unique looks and sound are great conversation starters. The shape reminds me a bit of early romantic guitars (the Rover's upper bout is smaller, but it has the same general proportions of neck to body, and is in the range for scale length and nut width).<br /><br />The nylon one (RO20) has been out of production but once a batch of them showed up at a guitar place in the Adirondacks (hint hint). I snapped one up then and really like it, since I mostly play classical. However, IMO the steel-string has a better steel-string sound than the nylon has a nylon-string sound, but that could just be because I've heard so many more smaller steel stringed instruments than nylon ones, and thus the familiarity.<br /><br />Another out-of-production item related to the Rover is the EZ Microphone Pickup, aka the W-ROMP. It's an endpin condenser mic that fits the Rover specifically and takes the place of the ordinary endpin, leaving you a 1/4"" output jack. I found someone who didn't want his and got it, and it is so cool and works so well. You have to fashion a soundhole cover, however, to avoid feedback, if you're plugged in. There are, of course, other options for amplification, such as soundboard transducers, under-saddle pickups, clip-on mics, etc. But the W-ROMP is great because you just install it and leave it there. Note, I've heard that the mic can bump up against one of the bridge pins, so you may need to adjust the stiff extension wire to account for this. Mine is mounted in my nylon one, which doesn't have endpins, so it's not a problem I encounter. I hope Washburn offers these again. They're inexpensive and fun.<br /><br />I recommend stringing it with silk & steel strings, they feel very good and sound very good on this guitar. If you find the guitar hard to play, or have some fret buzz, don't forget to have the string height and neck profile properly adjusted, if necessary.<br /><br />Update January 2015:<br /><br />The zipper pulls on my Rover cases are all falling apart at the same time - not just at the solder points but through the (cheap) metal of the pull tabs themselves. Also, and perhaps not surprisingly, I've had a couple screws (the ones holding the fabric cover on) strip themselves out of where they were screwed in to what I presume is a rigid foam body. I've set about gluing these back in place, but the overall point is that the case has a limited life. A local alteration shop quoted $20 per case to replace the zipper pulls, plus the cost of the pulls themselves. The woman there commented that usually zipper pulls have a size on the back, and that these did not, so finding four that fit (two for the body and two for the external pocket) might be tricky, as she gets them in an assorted pack. Note, I have seen a new case selling for $35, so putting more into the old case may not be wise, particularly if it is made with the same cheap metal pulls. It has lasted probably 5 years or more, traveling a few times a year; also, I have recently kept my Rovers in their case during winter (about a dozen weeks) with guitar humidifiers to counter the dry air from our home's gas heat. So I'm now getting in and out of the cases probably a couple dozen times a year. Whether buying a new case every few years is worth it is to me an open question. I doubt I would trust the Rovers for airline travel with anything less, frankly. But I am starting to question whether they should still be my first choice for a travel guitar. They're terrific and fun instruments in their own right, but I didn't expect the cases' fasteners to self-destruct after 5 years of fairly light use.",[],B000H927P0,B00E3X5USC,AGSEJFHE6A5EPKD64ZSNTUCHCW4A,1367721727000,0,False,2013-05-05 02:42:07.000

3.0,My Review,"So I ordered the MBOX2 Mini because it is a necessary evil.<br />The porduct is great...once you get it working.  I spent 4 hours trying to download the Pro-Tools software to my Dell Laptop only to be told that it was incompatible by Digidesign Technical Support.  But after a $250 investment, I was not about to give up just because some unwilling fella on the phone tells me that I should go out and buy a Mac (hell no.)<br />I downloaded the digital file from Pro-Tools, version 8.0.3, and voila, it works.  It would have been really nice if the seller had noted the necessary computer and or processer to make this software work properly.  It could have saved me alot of pain and heartache...and the official Pro-Tools website lists all kinds of compatable laptops(after clicking about 8 links to actually find it...I think they are trying to hide the lack of compatable interfaces...)...however I was only able to actually find one that is even for sale anywhere....and Pro-Tools is not compatable with Windows 7...So one would need to go out and buy a computer from the apple empire for it to even work if you went out and bought a compatable computer.<br />It seems awefully ridiculous that the standard in audio recording and editing is not yet up to speed with the Windows based system.<br />However, once I got it up and running, it's great!

I omitted that washer until the material compresses and just went with the c-clip with no issues over a year later.<br /><br />Be advised you will need a drill bit (exact size is in the instructions) to install these so the wood in your instrument doesn't split by driving the screw too deep or reaming out the screw.

3.0,Beautiful -- but I gave it away. Here's why,"This lovely little instrument arrived in reasonable time, well packaged, well presented in a small box with a green knotted and beaded necklace cord. The instrument, which they call ""jade"", is actually a kind of turquoise color, and the green necklace cord seems to clash a bit, to my mind. Shades of blue would be better.<br /><br />There are two reasons I gave this ocarina away:<br /><br />1. The soprano sound really is super high-pitched. If I'd had small children, I would have kept it. This high-pitched ocarina necklace would be perfect for camping trips, when we give children whistles to wear in case they get lost. The soprano ocarina would be a good substitute for the whistles. It's quite piercing.<br /><br />2. (and this is the main reason I gave it away) The holes on this ocarina are a bit different than others I've tried. To be able to play this particular ocarina well, I think one needs quite small hands. My hands are medium-ish for women, but with long fingers. When I try to play this ocarina, my hands and fingers are curled up and tight, trying to not only play it, but just to even hold it.<br /><br />LONG STORY SHORT:<br /><br />I picked this ocarina because it's lovely and I love the unique. However, for me, as an adult musician, I found it difficult to hold and too high pitched. I think this instrument is better suited to children, or those with small hands. But it is beautiful, and plays soprano well.",[],B00FJ8J1RG,B01MQUEW0X,AF56WI5IUQEMHXBONC6OJ5IDZQNQ,1619216788690,0,True,2021-04-23 22:26:28.690

5.0,Great For Beginners.,"If you are a beginner, this is great. I've always had an interest in the violin and old-time fiddle music, but I've always heard that it is a difficult to learn, and never picked it up. Until recently, but I still had some reservations and didn't want to pay a large amount of money for something I may or may not play again. So this was perfect. It has everything you need (although you might want to get better strings, I did, along with some better bows),. It came ready to play, nearly right out of the case, I did have to make some minor tuning adjustments, out of my own personal preferences, than anything else. I've since had gone up in size (I needed more room on the fingerboard to spread my fingers as they should be, this one was a bit smaller than I thought it would be), and sound quality is pretty good for such a small instrument, though, I felt it could have been better.

5.0,"Small thing, big bother","This saddle is likely one of the best; a lot of careful design work has gone into it.  The problem with it (and with other replacement saddles) is that its presence in your house is a clear sign that you are up to your jowels in a difficult situation.  Getting out of it with a resonator that plays how you want it to will take courage and committment because fitting this thing is freaking hard, terribly tedious and requires taking off the hood of the resonator numerous times.  This particular saddle, as well as being so tall that the action would be Rabelaisian without modification, turned out also to be too wide, so I had to sand off a huge chunk of the bottom to get a playable instrument, being careful to take the material off in steps to avoid the dreaded resonator buzz, and then turn around and carefully trim/sand off the sides so that I could get the hood back on.  The bottom e landed up perilously close to the edge, which bothered me so much I sanded down another saddle I had and tossed the chopped one.  The second one worked, and I am happy.  Frankly, though, I wish I had just left the action the way it was.  I did finally get to where I could fret the instrument, and I tell myself that the playability and sound is better now.  But that's probably just cognitive dissonance.  So much tedium, aggravation and sheer exhaustion in such small thing.  And drills and sanders and gauges.  And screwdrivers.  If you are just a naive amateur guitarist who fancies playing Little Martha on a resonator like Dickie Betts on Sundays and has no other great passion and special interest in having an easy-to-fret resonator, my advice is develop your slide technique and leave the action alone.  If you take off that hood, you are automatically in an iffy, tortuous situation.  Take it to a setup pro if you just can't live with the action.  You will be much happier.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZyKGV0WaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZyKGV0WaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZyKGV0WaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07SCQQBJ9,B07SCQQBJ9,AEWIN2GOBCNSVWYHQNJYPAFVZBQQ,1669841141145,0,True,2022-11-30 20:45:41.145

5.0,You can't go wrong,"[[VIDEOID:af56e5c59555e9862f1922a2d605dd39]] USB-VOX Plugable Microphone<br /><br />I would like to begin this review by stating that I did in fact receive the product for free in exchange for my unbiased opinion. With that being said, lets dive into it.<br /><br />The USB-VOX microphone seems to be targeting the same demographic as the Blue Snowball and Blue Yeti. They‚Äôre somewhat beginner microphones that can produce professional results in the right hands. The device lacks any physical switches or buttons, so sadly no neat little dB switches or bass reduction. While I would like to see those I can understand why they aren‚Äôt here, as these results can be achieved in post and it keeps the microphone body looking ‚Äúclean cut‚Äù. Aesthetically speaking, the Vox microphone is gorgeous, very reminiscent of a top of the line studio microphones, aside from the Plugable logo on the front. The single blue LED is a power indicator only, and sadly does not indicate when it is in use. The unit itself is quite hefty for its size, with a mass of 262 grams without the stand. The stand itself isn‚Äôt as hefty, but still maintains sturdiness. I do wish the legs on the tripod were a bit longer though, because getting it balanced is hard when it is so top heavy. Once you get it set, it‚Äôs pretty plug n play though. My computer recognized it immediately and I was using it right away. The quality is pretty close to a Yeti, and I‚Äôd say its for sure better than a snowball. Which makes sense with the price point that Plugable has chosen. I‚Äôll include a test sample from the microphone, although be aware there is background noise from my computer fans. All in all it‚Äôs a great microphone for anyone looking to podcast or do voice overs with, I genuinely have no complaints big enough to deduct a star. The product delivers on expectations at a good price point.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714QJWAFs7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714QJWAFs7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714QJWAFs7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zM7ZyralL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zM7ZyralL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zM7ZyralL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814kpC6JUyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814kpC6JUyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814kpC6JUyL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01K38WK1A,B01K38WK1A,AFK76XPUPXCIEQ6T4MG6GSOYF2CQ,1471975828000,3,True,2016-08-23 18:10:28.000

5.0,Great speaker for the money and for specific use,"This speaker is overall great for the money. It has crisp, clean sound and is loud enough for specific uses, such as small outdoor events or for DJ wedding applications where electricity is not available. Frequency range is 55Hz to 20kHz, so if you're looking for low end bass, this is not your unit. However, bass is still present and clear and mixed well within the full-range sound overall. Obviously you shouldn't buy this to rock the house bass-wise due to it's size, but if you need a battery-powered speaker for mobility sake, this is a great buy for the money. The only variable that is annoying and I can't figure out why they spent time putting this feature in the unit, is that every time you power it up, a  sampled voice tells you ""Power On!"" fairly loudly and also announces things like mode change...switching from bluetooth to line input, etc. Completely useless and unnecessary. If you are a mobile DJ, you're going to want to turn this unit on and get your mode set before attendees show up to the ceremony, or else everyone is going to be looking at you briefly. Lol!

5.0,Negative reviews are mostly based on peoples ignorance.,"The negative reviews of this product are almost entirely based on lack of knowledge and not reading the specs. This is a good short boom. It would be used for things like guitar amps, snare drums, hi-hats, and other items that require a shorter stand for miking. I give it 5 stars because I read the ad... so I was aware they were short stands. I needed about a half dozen of these. I own a small sound company and needed them for instrument miking, etc. The price is about the best there is at the moment.... and they're reasonably well built. It may not survive numerous world tours with a major sound company. But for me, it's just fine. The base is small but chunky, and weighted nicely to support things like SM-57's, and 421's.

5.0,Not the same as I had before but worth the price,"Years ago,  I purchased a pair of AKG 240 headphones.  I remember seeing them frequently in music videos from the late 1980s and early 1990s.  I had a glossy brochure and remember how the brochure stated that there were passive radiators around the headset that added to the low bass.  I loved those headphones and used them for over 10 years.  Over time, I lost track of what happened to my originals.  I remember I paid about $150.00 for them.<br /><br />These headphones looked very much like the ones I had. There were still positions for the passive radiators but the new headphones do not have any.  The new version seems very similar to the original cosmetically and is as comfortable as I remember.  The sound of these headphones are very good good for headphones going for about $60.00.  However, these do not sound as great as the originals did.  There are not a lot of over-the-ear headphones in this price range.  I rate these headphones high on value and comfort.  It is disappointing that these are a step down than the original name sake but on their own. they are a good value.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I have several headphones.  I have a pair of Grado SR200s.  I also have an AKG K619s and a pair of Status headphones.  I tested all of them using Alice Francis'  &#34;Shoot Him Down&#34;.  The AKG K619s sounded better than the Status headphones which were a bit too shrill.  Unfortuantely, the AKG's were the most uncomfortable headphones of the bunch.  The Grado SR200s sounded very natural and laid back.  The AKG 240s were at least as comfortable as the Grado SR200s.

Kind of ends there, though. Several strings buzz and I can't isolate the reason. It's not fretting out, nut looks fine. I suspect it has something to do with the bridge.

5.0,Excellent product,"I'm a mobile dj and a certified audio engineer so I take how I sound at every event very seriously. If your only interested in sounding like a club with nothing but a lot of distorted bass and just want something to get you by then maybe you should consider something else, there are other brands that can do that. My other system is a pair of Pyle Pro's and I got what I paid for. I was on a tight budget and did the best with what I could until I afford and save for something else. Seriously, this is an excellent quality product and I have many years working in audio experience. I suggest if your considering the K12's, go to a distributor and ask for a demo and test for yourself. Have a comparison of Mackies, Alto's, JBL or whatever they have to compare and then listen to the K12's. I could not believe the difference and was sold on QSC, I recently bought a pair and do not regret it. No issues with dropping out, overheating or rattles as other reviews said. Let me point out the K12's are NOT a subwoofer so don't treat them or expect them to act as one. They DO deliver a full range including some great bass even at lower volumes and if used correctly with a sub they blow other systems I have heard away. Are they cheap priced? No, but your getting a piece of equipment that not only sounds awesome it offers a wide variety of features that other brands don't and most of all my client's are happy.

1.0,These drums are great BUT apparently the metal is cheaply made and their customer service sucks,"I used to drum when I was a teenage and decided to get back into it back in April 2019.  I didn't want to buy a full drum kit due to space and noise, so I began researching electric drum kits and discovered the Alesis Nitro Mesh kit.  It's easy to set up, it sounds good (volume control and alternating the sound of the various drums is pretty good but not the best).<br /><br />Anyways, I've been playing casually now for about a year and seven months and three weeks ago, the metal for the bass pad stand literally snapped (I've attached pictures)!  That's really cheap metal.<br /><br />I reached out to Alesis and their response has basically been, ""Sucks to be you but because this was purchased over a year ago there's nothing we can do.  You'll need to purchase a new one from us.""  Now I get paying for the replacement if I had played so much I ate through the bass pad like a starving person eating a candy bar, or due to my own crappy playing I punctured the snare mesh... but this is a manufacturing issue that Alesis should replace at no cost to me.  This is like buying a car and the doors fall off when open them- it doesn't work and it's not the fault of the customer.<br /><br />Secondly, the person ""assisting me"" straight up ghosted me for six days giving me a response after I told them it was not acceptable to make me pay for a manufacturing defect.  After six days of prodding, the response was the same- ""sucks to be you, but we'll happily take your money and ship you a new one.""<br /><br />Sadly, based on this, I can't recommend this company or their equipment to anyone.  These types of bullying practices are crap and putting the onus of replacing this on me when it's their own faulty materials used in manufacturing is not a good customer service policy.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WUhFpYreL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WUhFpYreL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WUhFpYreL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WUhFpYreL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WUhFpYreL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WUhFpYreL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rSpA5HS5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rSpA5HS5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rSpA5HS5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rSpA5HS5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rSpA5HS5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rSpA5HS5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07BW1XJGP,B0BXLY8HJG,AFAXR5CCYIHIKUV7YULRTEFW5LSQ,1615475317159,2,True,2021-03-11 15:08:37.159

I am keeping it even though I was gifted a 16 string for Christmas. The 16 string lyre I have now doesn‚Äôt have as beautiful of sound quality, but it‚Äôs so much easier to find music for.

5.0,Easy to setup 2 input audio interface,This interface is easy to set up and connects easily to Windows 10. It is rated in the quality that it can capture(24Bit/192kHz) . I really like the ring light around the input gain volumes which indicate the input level of each channel. The enclosure is beefy and seems like it will hold up well. The inputs seem to meet acceptable build quality. 48V phantom power is a must with most studio microphones. Input audio quality is a good quality and all but the most inclined ears will find it pleasing and acceptable. Headphone output works well with the local volume knob. Headphone output can be used as an audio output from your computer and as a monitor for your inputs. USB C Cable is included and is a decent length. Not a name brand but keeps up with the best in this price range. Comes with a USB C To USB A adapter which is a nice touch.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618YaSvM0FL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618YaSvM0FL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618YaSvM0FL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QaBxja2RL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QaBxja2RL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QaBxja2RL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kL2ITvgyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kL2ITvgyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kL2ITvgyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BGK5LHTH,B0C5WSJKZ3,AF3WNICZ5L5PJMPC6ITZN64YEYUQ,1670480178590,2,False,2022-12-08 06:16:18.590

5.0,A Good Deal,"This instrument is a nice one. I understand that it isn't THE best ukulele out there (when compared to a professional model) but given its price with the bundle, you get a fantastic musical instrument. It looks and sounds beautiful. The tuning pegs are geared, so precision tuning is quite easy.<br />I was a bit worried that it might end up sounding like a toy, due to its low price. I was quite pleased to see that I worried for nothing, it sounds marvelous.<br /><br />The only problem that I've had with it, is that the low C string goes a bit out of tune with each higher fret. A bit of tinkering with the nut managed to lessen this problem, and I suspect a bit more tinkering would fix it altogether. This seems to be a common ukulele issue, and doesn't reflect the quality of the instrument.<br /><br />I had never before seen a tuner like the one included with the instrument. It clips onto the ukulele, and finds the tuning through the vibration of the instrument. Its 3 different settings are fairly useful, but I generally will use it as a standard chromatic tuner. It has done its job well for me.<br /><br />The carrying bag is padded, but I personally wish that it was a bit more heavy-duty. It seems suitable to protect against mild bumps and drops. However, that protection will only go so far. The ukulele is not protected from being crushed, which could be a real hazard given its size. However, a gig-bag generally doesn't offer that kind of protection anyway, and considering that it is essentially free, it does very good for its price.<br /><br />The ukulele club is a nice feature to include as well.

It's lightweight but rugged; the only downside to the construction that I've noticed is a slight rattling at high volumes.<br /><br />It has a great sparkly clean sound, although the volume is limited for practice in a band setting, it's plenty for solo practice.  Punching the overdrive on adds a new dimension of volume, warmth and grit, at the cost of clarity, naturally.  The overdrive is very warm and natural sounding for a small solid state amp, but can get fairly muddy as well, so tweak the settings as needed, and be aware that you'll never get a modern metal sound from this without pedals.<br /><br />For classic British invasion tones, this amp will do the job nicely, not to mention stylishly and affordably.  For more modern, complex, or high-gain music, either look to a modeling amp or expanding your pedalboard.  While I really do like the fundamentals of this amp, it is also quite limited, without even a basic reverb setting.  A simple reverb (and preferably delay as well) would be a great improvement, but it's nonetheless an excellent practice amp, even with its limitations.<br /><br />For comparison, I had a Fender Frontman 10w amp and still have a Fender Mustang I.  The Frontman sounded cheap and thin compared to this Vox, even though it cost nearly as much.  The Fender Mustang remains the vastly more versatile amp, and is capable of more bass and volume, but the Vox Pathfinder nonetheless outclasses it in simplicity, ruggedness, and personality.

5.0,Nicest 12-string I've played,"Just picked one of these up a couple weeks ago, and I have to say it's the most pleasant 12-string I've had my hands on in the 40-some years I've been playing. Sure you could drop 1800-2500 for a Ric, but for +/- 300, this thing is quite good. 12 Grovers are sure to make the headstock heavy, and they do, but the action is nice, it has a sweet sound at low levels and a surly growl from the humbuckers if you crank it out. The neck pickup can get a little muddy, like most 12-strings do if you don't use a light touch, but the bridge pick-up gives you a nice approximation of that Byrds jingle-jangle with a bit of compression. Overall, a nice range of sounds and certainly something I wouldn't be afraid to gig with. The set-up seemed fine out of the box, and though a peek through the f-holes is a tad ugly, the rest of the fit and finish is outstanding. The frets are smooth and confortable, and it just as easy to hit a bar chord on this as it is on my Strat. Frankly, it's easier to play than my 6-string SG. I suspect you won't see this at this price for long, so if you're so inclined it's worth jumping on.

Now it does add compression to the signal, which is fine with me as a bassist, because I play with compression. So this may not be to everyone's liking, but if you are looking for a nice tight punch it works great in a band mix.<br /><br />Pros: great price, no interference, no unwanted noise and adds a bit compression to the signal, so no need to use a compression pedal<br />Con: The unit adds compression to the singal so may not work for everyone<br />Even with this Con I still give it a 5 star rated it worked flawlessly for me as a gigging bassist that is what I need.<br />Edit: I am now having the same issue with the cable as the user above, on the body pack. I have already done a work around myself as did another user Scott to keep the show going, but it is still a great unit for the price as he did I just wanted to bring this issue to the attention of future buyers I had a cable that I could use instead of the one supplied<br /><br />Bassist for a New Jersey Classic Rock Tribute band.",[],B0046LGS0A,B0046LGS0A,AGSJSKLP4JXITYFMXRQF324L67AQ,1520356096915,4,True,2018-03-06 17:08:16.915

3.0,Pretty good beginner kit,"So this is my first ukulele but I play guitar. Honestly the fact that it came with its own carry bag and a spare set of strings was why I picked this one. I don't care for the picks or the ""polishing cloth"". The tuner is a nice touch and does actually include the battery, but when you get this you'll need to know which string is which because it obviously doesn't come tuned, so getting it into tune with just the clip on is a bit of a struggle. The other thing is these strings seem to go out of tune a lot. Nylon strings have a tendency to stretch initially and take a little while to settle but these seem a little excessive, I'll probably end up getting a different set anyways. The ukulele itself is alright, everything on it is plastic and the quality is alright. I mean I like playing it, its a cool little fun thing to mess around with when I don't feel like playing my guitar. I also think this would be kinda a neat thing to bring camping since its so small.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81chWpP1wRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81chWpP1wRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81chWpP1wRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81lpgPxF-4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81lpgPxF-4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81lpgPxF-4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rPvalX3mL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rPvalX3mL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rPvalX3mL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09HTV85XQ,B09HTT3XY8,AFF4ACEVCDJYOXSB7UDGG2R5PDIQ,1657927253215,0,False,2022-07-15 23:20:53.215

4.0,"A little bit of reverb goes a long, long way ...","I just bought a couple of new amps -- one without reverb.  This is a bass amp, but I play guitar and I really missed the effect.  So, an experiment: The amp has a 1/4&#34; TS socket, so I decided to try putting a brand new RV600 reverb pedal between the preamp & the power amp via a TS 3-ended cable.  Nope, it didn't work so good.  The reverb effects were okay but a hard lick on my guitar would make the amp's speaker rattle like crazy, even when the volume was very low.  So don't spend money trying this.<br /><br />On the other hand, when used as designed, the RV600 sounded pretty good.  Especially considering the cost.  I put it between my guitar and the bass (?) amp and have no problem at all. Everything's roses.  And since I'll always use the pedal when the amp is powered up I'm attaching it to the amp cabinet out of stomping range.  This pedal is not for stomping.  I also plan to find an AC adapter from my junk drawer, so that will also not be a problem.<br /><br />I do agree that not all of the settings are great, but there's some that I like and can play with.

5.0,This is the best small keyboard!!!,"This is the best small keyboard!!!<br /><br />This thing is amazing.  Was looking for a small MIDI keyboard to place in front of the monitor, as well as to throw in a laptop bag for travel.  This is the only compact keyboard that I could find with FULL SIZE KEYS that fits in both places.<br /><br />I noted a few comments about click noise from the keys.  It's not any louder than the clack or clunk from any plastic synth keyboard, and I have several synth action keyboards to compare this with. No bother at all.<br /><br />If you download the Xkey Plus app, you can configure the key velocity response to your liking.  It is very easy to play and responds well.  I don't have any issue with the minimum key travel depth.<br /><br />Maybe not for your main keyboard, but for actually playing a virtual instrument on your computer, you need one of these.  I think it's a bit more fun to play than a real keyboard.  The fast action makes it easy to glide across the keys in a way that would be difficult with real keys.  For more on keyboard instrument evolution, visit the Roli website and take a look at the Roli Seaboard.  Continuous touch and fingertip expression.  Very cool, but they don't come cheap.<br /><br />The Xkey 25 is less than $100, the frame is made from aluminum, not cheap plastic. It's well designed and feels solid.<br /><br />If you just want to trigger drum beats or loops, maybe one of the mini-key controllers with trigger pads and mixer knobs would suit you better.  I tried one of those, but returned it and got this instead.  Couldn't stand the small size of the mini-keys.  Overall very satisfied with the CME Xkey 25 and highly recommend it!!!<br /><br />There are compact MIDI trigger and mixer controllers without keys that would pair up nicely with this if you need the additional functions for Ableton Live or something like that.<br /><br />Oh yeah, about that orange USB cable.  It's loud.  But on the positive side, it helps you find it fast in the back of your computer or gear rack.  And it's also long ... very, very, long.",[],B00DU2VKV8,B0B3LLNVNC,AHRL4DBOA5L64WE2BFAG6JESZL7A,1474321214000,20,True,2016-09-19 21:40:14.000

5.0,Prepping the foam tiles,"When your package arrives it will be ultra compressed and wrapped in flexible Packaging. It's hard to overstate how highly compressed the foam is inside this Packaging. The best way to unwrap it is with a pair of surgical safety scissors ( the ones with the blunt tip on the bottom so you don't gouge your patient). Once you have them unwrapped you simply locate a place in your studio or your office or wherever you intend to install them, and place the tiles on the floor or on countertops, and allow them to sit for 24 hours. This should allow enough time for the foam to expand to its original dimensions. However, if you purchased a combination of black plus some other color such as gray, the non black tiles may appear to be completely flat and totally defective even after 24 hours. My advice to you, immediately after unwrapping the package, is to reconstitute each tile by soaking it in a full sink of water then wringing it out before setting each tile aside to dry. Note, you can fold each tile prior to wringing it out but be cautious as you fold the wet foam because you can damage it if you're not careful. The truth is, i wouldn't even wait the initial 24 hours for the foam to self-restore. Hit the water, wait for them to dry, and your non black tiles should look similar, if not identical in dimensions to those that are black.<br /><br />As far as performance and quality of these tiles, they're fine.

This is a quality mic, just a little ""different"" than the Shure in terms of tonal character.  The V7 sounds a tad bit ""brighter,"" and may be better when singing with a loud band.  But for me, strictly a vocalist, I seem to prefer the Shure, which is a little ""warmer.""  I have the Shure 58-S, which means it has an On/Off switch that I have always found to be handy for instantly cutting off the volume from my end.

5.0,APX still a good buy.,"We started with the original APX guitar which is FAR superior in tone and playability to the current generation, but the APX is still a good buy and a decent instrument. We are still recommending it to beginner students and as that vital backup for our gigging customers. The original is hugely deeper/bigger sounding than the current generation which sounds so thin when played side-by-side, both amplified and unamplified. To get a better amped sound all EQ-low at 12, EQ-mid at max right, EQ-high at 12/mid, mid bias slider (I forget what they call it) all the way to the right; sounds pretty good setup like that and is stage friendly given the detents on the EQ knobs. The newer models are marketed to have better more realistic / bigger tone, but sadly it's the case of marketing tactic (I can't get into a marketing dissertation here, but marketers frequently take a liability/flaw and write copy that turns it all around. It's how we're taught. Sorry.) One last word of advice: Unless you can touch and test drive a pre-owned APX STAY AWAY!! These guitars lend themselves to the kind of abuse that uses up and instrument. For example, of the 5 we regularly repair and setup, one is our ""mood"" guitar that sits on the stand onstage and gets generally kicked around and abused except for the handful of slow acoustic songs per nigh, one is our guest guitar (at which it excels! Plays like an electric and can sound like an electric or acoustic with tweaking), the rest are customer guitars that are used the same as our mood guitar.

Not only is the tuning acceptable, it is nearly spot on. Most notes are within 2 cents, the worst are out less than 10 cents.

It arrived in a very nice case for storage. It comes with a cleaning cloth to keep it polished and fingerprint free when not in use. Also comes with a nice pouch. Very easy to use. Feels great in your hands. The sound this harmonica puts out is beautiful. I have always loved the sound of the harmonica and this one is amazing. The notes are marked very well and easy to read. Comes with an instruction pamphlet to teach you the beginning steps of playing the harmonica. This would make a great gift for any music lover. I am very impressed with the harmonica.

If you don't have access to a professional recording studio and dozens (or hundreds) of effect pedals, but wish you did, you simply must get this thing. This will turn a decent guitar, amp, and laptop into a recording studio with everything you need to get any sound you are looking for. As long as your guitar stays in tune and your amp sounds decent and loud enough for your needs, leave the rest to this pedal. Anything from ultra-clean to ultra-dirty, delays, reverb... everything.<br /><br />The fact that it also has a looper is gravy (go price single-function loopers). The fact that it ALSO has drum beats is gravy on top of gravy (again, price single-function devices). I know some folks complain that you cant use the drums at the same time with the looper... well... go price out separate devices that JUST do loops and drums. You can get another one of these, run it in-line, and still be $500 ahead and have all the effects AND a backup effects pedal for gigs.<br /><br />The software that comes with it simplifies the process of setting up custom sounds, and allows you to back up the settings and restore them to the device. If you have two of them, then you can copy the settings from one to the other, or have an extra 50 custom settings (if you really think you need 100 custom presets).<br /><br />The website also has some custom presets for various genres and specific songs.<br /><br />This device is, by far, the best value out there when it comes to expanding the sounds you have available to you.

4.0,"Good value, but small arm damage","This review is for the &#34;7 Multi Guitar Bass Folding Stand Stage 7 Holder Rack Guitar Stand&#34;<br /><br />After doing a little shopping around, this was the best priced 4+ guitar stand at about $33 after shipping. The stand arrived in a somewhat long rectangular box, the packing was decent, but the nuts+bolts bag was torn which caused half of them to be tossed around in the box, thankfully all the screws were intact.<br />The stands instructions were pretty easy to follow, took me about 10-15 minutes to set up.<br />The reason i gave this product a 4/5 is because one of the main arms were bent once received, this looked to be a manufacturing error, because the shipping box was in perfect condition. The bend was not to severe, i was able to move it into the correct position for the screws to properly fit. At this price, i don't necessarily expect perfection.<br />The foam padding is pretty thick, which makes me confident that it will not damage any of my guitars. Once a few guitars are added, it's pretty stable, although, without the extra weight, it doesn't seem to hold up very well, which shouldn't be much of a problem, because who buys a stand, and doesn't put something on it?<br />Overall i'd recommend the product",[],B0051WAJ5S,B07SZLTL1W,AEBC343KWB25ZKL2JSAD2VL3PKLQ,1358523488000,1,True,2013-01-18 15:38:08.000

5.0,Great pedal at a great price!,"I'm just a home player now, so trying to get by with a smaller pedal board.  My main gain pedal is a zVex Distortron, which is basically the drive side of their Box of Rocks.  Fantastic pedal.  Not a rat, but a great drive pedal.  But that's $200 pedal and its W I D E on the board. So I took a chance on this nasty little mouse, and boy was i surprised!  It wasn't noisy at all (compared to my fuzz!) and had a pretty wide range of tones, with the filter control seeming to give more variation than just a regular tone control.  I've been using the classic mode more than the hyper mode so far, as its a little smoother.  But as you would expect, it can get very nasty, in a very good way!  sounded good with single coils as well, which was a nice surprise.<br />The biggest difference between it and the Distortron was that with the Distortron, I could always hear the natural sound of the guitar, even with heavy gain.  Sorta like hearing the strings individually when strumming as opposed to just a wall of gain.  It was a small difference, but there.  The Dark Mouse was a bit more focused sounding.<br />But overall, considering the price and the saving of space, this Dark Mouse will be staying on my board!<br />I will be honest and say this was a Donner promotional item for me, but my review is 100% honest.  If I didn't like the pedal, I'd say it.  Thanks..",[],B07P1ZLSG8,B0BH599FJY,AEVLTRYALOW2CLTD4CPPZ2OMK54A,1554478250626,3,True,2019-04-05 15:30:50.626

5.0,Perfect operation and better audio capture than the internal iPhone microphone.,"This is a well-made corded lavaier microphone that eliminates the need for a TRS to TRRS adapter to a headphone connection by using a lightning connector.  The phone recognizes the mic immediately and can then be used for voice recording or in conjuction with the phones video capture function.<br /><br />Tests comparing the sound produced by this mic in contrast to the internal mic produced much more pleasant audio with an increase in lower frequency capture capability.  Voice is much more natural using this mic.<br /><br />The 12-ft cable allows for an extended reach which may eliminate the need for a wireless system if using with for selfies or for near-cam vlogging and video.  This is a great system for me while I make food, cooking, and product reviews for my YouTube channel.<br /><br />It's an easy FIVE STAR rating for me and an honest and very hearty recommendation for anyone needing recording capability on their iPhone.

5.0,"Awesomeness, + correct DMX table","Consider, 1st, that just an old-fashioned Par 38 can, without a lamp (or gels), will set you back about 25 bucks, and these cost just a little more (each) at quantity 4 and a little less in an 8-pack!  Lately with new music & staging technology I find myself saying &#34;we would have KILLED for something like this when I was playing clubs in the 80's!&#34;  Maybe that's showing my age, but I can't help thinking about what an awesome light show one of my old funk bands could have had with just a few hundred dollars worth of these units.<br /><br />I requested four of these as a gift to try out and am now deciding whether to use my Amazon points to get 4 more or go ahead and get 8 before they change the spec.  We have some RGBA Chauvet EZPar 64s (basically rechargeable SlimPar 64s) where I work and these are easily as bright, maybe a tiny bit brighter. Of course they're not comparable to 1k incandescent pars or 575 watt Source 4's, but for a portable club rig I think they'll be pretty awesome, maybe comparable to a couple-hundred-watt incandescent? -- but with better colors.  The Chauvets have an amber channel that I appreciate - oranges & yellows are much deeper and truer, where the I3C yellows seem alternately greenish or pinkish - but not enough for my purposes to pay $100 per light.  Actually, if not for these, I would still be waiting for the time that I could afford to start building up a light show.  8-12 of these, some stands, and Freestyler is definitely a start... with the name brands that would set me back $800-1200, more or less, but this route is less than $300.<br /><br />On the downside, because of the fewer (but brighter) LEDs you get a lot more RGB color fringing in shadows.  Also so far the fades seem pretty stair-steppy (using Freestyler DMX automatic fades), but I didn't have a DMX terminator so that *may* have some effect.  Also, the &#34;directions&#34; that come with them are for a different, 7-channel light so the DMX table is completely wrong (see below).  Also, as other reviewers have said, it doesn't seem very rugged.  The yoke is pretty thin metal and I have fears of screwing the little yoke knobs down too tight and twisting the sockets out of the plastic housing.  Also, for better or worse, the beam is pretty narrow, couldn't give you an angle, but it seems pretty much the same as the EZPars.<br /><br />Here is the correct 6-CHANNEL DMX table, courtesy of a half-hour with one of the lights and a Chauvet Obey 40: ch.1 = 0-255 RGB (ch 2-4, doesn't affect Ch.6 color presets/macros) master level; ch.2 = 0-255 Red, ch.3 = 0-255 Blue, ch.4= 0-255 Green; ch.5 = 1-255 strobe/speed (255 is fastest); ch.6 = color macros, overrides ch 1-4, values 1-149=color presets; 150-169=red/blue color alternation & speed (169 fastest); 170-210; 7-color macro, sharp transition, speed; 211-255: all-colors crossfade, speed (255 is fastest).  Note that the strobe channel works in conjunction with any of the color channels (unlike that other brand), 1-4 unless 6 is active (overriding 1-4), so you can have strobes of any set color or jumping/fading between colors.<br /><br />Although I've figured out how to set the DMX channel and get a few macros going, I really couldn't begin to explain all the options using the menu on the back of the light.<br /><br />I guess I should take a point or so off for the lightweight build and bad directions but these are SUCH an incredible value...

Tunes nicely.  You still need to put some kind of muffling material in the drum if you want that dead thud sound, but it's probably the best sounding bass batter head I've heard without muffling.

5.0,It really is professional Guitar sound,"MULTI-TRACKING ON MY IPAD MINI:<br /><br />I've successfully recorded my first song using this device, and I have to say that it really delivers! I first recorded 2 electric guitar tracks (without going through my amp) and they sound really great with just GarageBand amp effects.<br /><br />I then plugged my bass guitar into this thing and that worked wonderfully as well. My cheap bass actually sounds great through the JAM and even the lowest tones on the instrument recorded with sonic clarity.<br /><br />I was going to stop there...but then I plugged my electronic drum set into the JAM and overdubbed my own drums on the track. I let a few musician friends listen to the recording and they honestly thought I used a real acoustic drum set to record it. Which is important to me because hard rock just doesn't sound right using synthetic percussion loops...<br /><br />To record some demo vocals for the track, I used a microphone input to 1/4 inch instrument cable, plugging the mic end into my cheap dynamic microphone and the instrument end into the JAM. After playing with the GAIN levels on the JAM, I was able to record some pretty decent vocals. If you don't have a mic that requires phantom power, the JAM will deliver the best possible mic sound (through an instrument cable). However, I plan to re-record these vocals with my new &#34;iRig PRE&#34; and condenser mic.<br /><br />SETUP:<br /><br />Setup was generally painless and quick:<br /><br />1. Take the JAM and cables out of the box.<br /><br />2. (optional) Stick the included velcro strip to the bottom of the device and the other end to a surface you wish to mount it on.<br /><br />3. Plug the Lightning, USB, or 30-pin cable into the JAM and your device (make sure your device is charged because you will not be able to plug it into A/C power while using the JAM).<br /><br />4. Plug in your instrument to the JAM with a 1/4 inch instrument cable (shorter cables can help improve sound latency, but I tested the device using a 10 foot cable and experienced almost no delay when using headphones to monitor the input).<br /><br />5. Open Garage Band, and select &#34;Guitar Amplifier&#34; (for amp effects & tuner) or &#34;Sound Recorder&#34; (for clean inputs).<br />  The JAM's indicator light will turn from blue to green, indicating you're ready to go.<br /><br />TIPS/WARNINGS:<br /><br />*Always check your JAM's gain levels to avoid clipping. For most electric guitars, you should leave the gain completely off on the JAM. Even with no gain, I had to turn my guitar's volume knobs down a bit to keep the JAM's &#34;Clipping&#34; light from flashing red. I recommend strumming the guitar as hard as you can and watching the JAM's light to make sure it won't clip before recording.<br /><br />* For people with newer devices that require &#34;Lightning&#34; cables instead of the old standard 30-pins, make sure the JAM you buy comes with the lightning cable. If it doesn't, a good adapter will cost you $30-$40.

3.0,"Good little harp. Great for blues, rock or just playing solo tunes.","This is a good little harp. The reeds bend well after a quick break in. And the notes are tuned properly for a diatonic.<br /><br />  In regards to quality and sound, it does have some air leaking on power blows and over blows, but so so many Honers in this price range. A little lost air here and there is to be expected. But the bronze reeds are well tuned and bend easily on the draw.<br /><br />  The one thing I had a really hard time with was the fact that the plates that your mouth slide on had sharp corners. They may not be sharp enough to cut and draw blood, but they‚Äôre definitely sharp enough to scrape if your lips or face run across it.<br /><br />  It‚Äôs located on the front. The slot that the cover rests in, creates a sharp point on each corner of the plate.<br /><br />  Now I checked my Honer Blue‚Äôs band against it because of similar design. I found the Honer also had a little bit sharp corner. In this case though, it seems they must tumble polish the part, as it‚Äôs not quite a s sharp as the corners on the Aklot.<br /><br />  I just hit the sharp edges with a jewler‚Äôs file and some sand paper. Then it was fine. I do want people to be aware though.<br /><br />  Aside from that, it‚Äôs a good little blues harp. That‚Äôs what I use it for.  I think a little more attention to detail will take it from good, to great.<br /><br />  Sharp edges on an instrument that‚Äôs played in the mouth, doesn‚Äôt show me that they‚Äôve gone above an beyond in understanding the customer experience.<br /><br />  That said, quality control being what it is, it‚Äôs entirely possible the unit you receive won‚Äôt have sharp corners, or that it was a one time failure to tumble clean the parts. Who‚Äôs to say.<br /><br />  Either way, a few minutes with some sand paper should have any sharp corner taken care of, and your all set to play after that.<br /><br />  This isn‚Äôt the loudest harmonica I‚Äôve heard, but it‚Äôs output will keep up with similarly priced offerings.<br /><br />  Overall it‚Äôs a good harp, sharp print on the body, good reeds, and a zippered case.<br /><br />  Though I‚Äôm partial to Honer and Suzuki, I‚Äôd recommend this to people who just want a budget harp to shred tunes out on.<br /><br />  Just watch out for those sharp corners!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+ZDy5dRSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+ZDy5dRSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+ZDy5dRSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817VWc+Jg4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817VWc+Jg4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817VWc+Jg4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81L9Ow+qo6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81L9Ow+qo6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81L9Ow+qo6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LtS8Y8cyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LtS8Y8cyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LtS8Y8cyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UQt8KpbyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UQt8KpbyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UQt8KpbyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81dYzC6mYsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81dYzC6mYsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81dYzC6mYsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B083LQNY4T,B08HV2JWL3,AGE4QOGZK6WGAMYRZMFGB5EJ3TNQ,1602866728780,2,False,2020-10-16 16:45:28.780

5.0,Great item if installed properly!,"I had very low expectations when I ordered this. The price seemed very low for the features. I bougt a decent quality Washburn acoustic that was in pretty bad shape but the neck was straight and the body was sound but very &#34;road worn&#34; I removed all the hardware and cleaned up the body, aside from a few nicks it was pretty nice. I cleaned up the hardware and as I was starting to reassemble it I decided to install a piezo pickup / preamp into the guitar. As a project I didn't want to invest a bunch of money in a pickup. I decided on this one because of the features and XLR out. It arrived as mentioned above in a Baggie with no instructions but there are several good videos online to get you through. You don't need a manual. Just install, put in battery, plug into amp and go. Mess with the EQ and volume and play. Tuner is self explanatory. The install is not easy, especially if you lack skills or experience in such things. You need the confidence to cut into your guitar's body and work with the bridge and restring. It's a great unit. Mine sounded astonishingly good. Everything works as advertised. It's hard to tell the difference between the modded Washburn and my mid level Ovation. The Washburn is a bit treble heavy but can be easily fixed with some EQ. Some tips to make things easier and make sure you get the optimal sound quality. 1) Watch the video that refers to this exact unit several times. 2) Trace the back of the preamp on a piece of cardboard. Do not trace the front or top of the unit, trace the metal back plate. This is critical or the unit will just fall into the guitar and your body will be toast. Cut out the shape you traced and test fit the preamp. Only when you can slide the preamp into the cut out with little pressure should you trace the shape onto the body (the area should be taped with blue painters tape, it will come off easier. Do not use duct tape). Use a Dremel type tool with a side cut bit or wheel and go very slowly. Try to fit the preamp and sand the edges until it slides into the hole. Go slowly and sand a little bit at a time until it just fits and slides in. Be careful at the corners. If you remove too much there will be nothing for the mounting screws to seat into. Repeat with the Jack panel. 3) Now for the part that will make all the difference in the sound quality. With the saddle still in the slot use a very thin sharpie or pencil and trace a line across the saddle where it goes into the bridge and remove the saddle. Throughly clean the saddle slot. Drill a hole only big enough to fit the piezo plug through the bridge and seat the piezo pickup into the slot. Carefully seat it all the way into the bridge. Place a sheet of 150 to 220 grit sandpaper on a flat hard surface. Sand the bottom of the saddle evenly until you reach the line you traced. This allows for the height of the pickup and retains the action of your guitar. Make sure the bottom of the saddle is smooth and flat! The more saddle surface that touches the pickup the better for transfer of vibrations to the pickup and soundboard. These tips are meant to augment the video and help get the best sound and appearence. I hope yours sounds as good as mine.

I cannot imagine lugging these to the car without a case (has shoulder strap). Speakers aren‚Äôt very heavy.<br /><br /> Work fine as a wedge monitor for larger gigs with electric guitar and drummer when I use QSC k.12 for foh.  I suspect the ZXA-1 could handle vox in that situation, but haven‚Äôt tried it.

4.0,Excellent sound isolation;  superior sound with the tighter fitting foam pad,"These are excellent for stage use if you have another source for your volume control.  I estimate that they have a sound isolation of 35db if you use a tight pair of foam adaptors which are included and easily applied.  Their sound quality was initially a bit of disappointment as I did not fit them with a tighter pair of foam pads.  If you pair them with the small pads, you will find them bass and midrange deficient.  Fitted properly they then have the typical Sennheiser balanced audiophile sound. They are good for playing drums as you get good definition from the music which easily can get lost in all the high harmonics from the drums.  The quality appears to be very high and they are some of the most comfortable in ear headphones I have ever used.  They are also very resistant to coming out of the ear and will not interfere with motorcycle helmets or isolation cans if you need even move sound reduction.  These require a bit of effort to get fitted to your ear the first time but you will be rewarded with great sound at this price.",[],B07FBBV6Y8,B07XW2Z5X1,AGXTFGO7KXIW257RRFLSA3C5VRWA,1590715751909,0,False,2020-05-29 01:29:11.909

2.0,Not worth the price! Bad videos!,"This seemed like a quality option, especially considering all that comes in the bundle, BUT I WAS WRONG! The instrument itself is great quality, but there are no instructions WHATSOEVER outside of the videos, which aren't helpful.<br />There was no itemized list of what should be in the bundle. There was no instruction on how to attach the strap. Nowhere was it written which notes the strings should be tuned to.<br />In order to get any instruction, you have to go to the website and register and then you have access to some bad videos. Starting at the beginning of the video series, had to sit through more than 30 minutes to get the three pieces of information I listed above. The guy talks A LOT about information you do not need. You cannot quickly read headings and skim to the part you need in consise bullet-points. Instead you have to sit through some guy talking a ton and just wait and hope that he concerts what you need to know.<br />Furthermore, the videos make no sense. Honestly I won't even get started because we'd be here all day.

5.0,Excellent sound,"I bought one of these a couple of years ago at a shop.  I had a chance to try it out in a sound booth against a Shure SM58, the standard mic found on every stage and studio anywhere.  The 58 is a great, durable mix but the Blue beat it for overall depth of sound quality.  Beware: there is nowhere to hide while singing into this mic.  It is an active mic, meaning it requires phantom power pushing from PA.  Don‚Äôt buy if you aren‚Äôt sure that your PA has phantom power.  It picks up every nuance of your vocals, good or bad, in amazingly sharp detail.<br />The only drawback with the older mic was that the plate with the 3 contact pins inside the cable insert came loose and pushed back into the cavity on bottom so that the pins don‚Äôt contact the female XLR cable terminal anymore.  Blue seems to have fixed this as there is a tiny hole drilled in side of the new mic with I‚Äôm guessing a set screw to hold the plate in place that the older mic doesn‚Äôt have.  I haven‚Äôt gotten around to repairing the old detached receptacle, but the new one I bought should hold up to abuse of connecting to cables over and over.",[],B06XCRP5FC,B06XCRP5FC,AFAJ7EG7UT7OLXEANM46TE7EJEWQ,1661468613316,0,True,2022-08-25 23:03:33.316

2.0,Don't get it from here,"There is buzzing stings on 1st and 3rd courses. The strings are uneven. Obviously not the advertised product cosmetically. It is missing red text and an emblem on the headstock. As shown in the 3rd picture, the machining is very bad. The tuners are atrocious. To get this instrument in working order it will need tuner and bridge replacement, as well as handiwork on the sketchy fretboard. It sounds nice if you ignore the buzzing, though it is almost always played amplified. My other problems are the strings that it comes with. They are extremely delicate and harsh; who's idea was it to put steel strings on a fretless instrument? The strings are similar to some terrible electric guitar strings, with the caveat of terrible gauges. I suggest to just buy 2 packs of light loop end guitar strings, though you won't be able to tune as high as usual and the thickest course won't be able to be tuned as a drone. Alternatively oud strings could be used.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1v5lCWhOFS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1v5lCWhOFS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1v5lCWhOFS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1+t-BfAWcS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1+t-BfAWcS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1+t-BfAWcS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1k-2erDvnS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1k-2erDvnS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1k-2erDvnS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08JHDQB46,B08JHDQB46,AEZLB6BZQZXKWDEYPS2SCFA4RAJA,1624589192302,0,True,2021-06-25 02:46:32.302

Pickups sound great. The preamp has enough treble and bass controls to go from &#34;not enough bass&#34; to &#34;way too much bass&#34; and same for treble. The fret ends are perfect, the neck is very comfortable. The frets are well polished and strings bend very easily on them. This is a great bass.

Also, there is a small black mark on one of the neck laminations; it's purely cosmetic.<br /><br />Cool features: The pickups have cut outs so you can place your thumb.

5.0,Works well for my Ibanez GSR100!,"This is a great case to store your instrument. It's not make to withstand the punishment of checked baggage and I wouldn't recommend standing on this case, nor would I call it waterproof. Like the other reviewers say, it's not a heavy duty case and you shouldn't expect the same performance out of it as you'd get from a $150 SKB case. I bought this case to store a relatively cheap ($200) Ibanez GSR100 bass. My Fender Jazz bass also fits nicely in this case, and probably any 34&#34; scale bass would fit.<br /><br />If you're just putting your bass in the car, storing it, or carrying it to a gig, this case will get the job done. Most of us want a little more protection than a gig bag offers, and this is a modestly priced alternative to the Gator cases. Definitely recommend it, especially if the instrument you're protecting is a cheap bass. If you have a $2500 Rickenbacker, I'd say you probably want to look for a better case than this one.<br /><br />And just an update, about a year and a half after buying the case, I'm still quite happy with it. I mostly just use it to take my bass out of the house and to store it in a closet, and the case is perfect for that. As a side note, I do have an SKB case for my Fender Jazz bass. This case is much lighter, which is good if you're carrying it around.<br /><br />Another update, this is a picture of the case with my GSR100. The case is about 2&#34; deep and about 20.5&#34;x14&#34;. You can see the body of my base pretty nicely fills that cavity for the body.

5.0,Great audio interface after one upgrade.,"TL;DR: If you have the M2 and are getting the playback failure error, try switching to a quality USB cable. Spending 10 bucks on a cable is far cheaper than buying a whole new audio interface.<br /><br />Longer review: Like many other people who bought the MOTU M2 USB interface, the playback signal would quit working for me on a pretty regular basis, at least a handful of times per week. I would have to cycle the power switch and then wait a few seconds for it to work again. I tried plugging it into several different USB ports on the back of my PC to no avail, and updating the driver/firmware didn't help either. Eventually, I was able to finally solve the problem completely by accident. How? Well, read on!<br /><br />MOTU gives you a painfully short USB cable with the M2. It's only 40 inches long (a little over 3 feet) and barely reached from my PC on the ground to the M2 sitting on my desk. So, I ended up ordering a new USB Type-A to Type-C cable (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08F2G3JNC/) that was over 6 feet long and gave me more freedom to place the M2 where I wanted it. The new cable was much thicker and better quality than the included cable, but it still came as a surprise to me that lo and behold, the cable switch fixed the issue of the mysterious playback signal failure! I'm no electrical engineer, but I assume based on what other reviewers here said about the M2 playback failure is that the new cable is able to provide more and/or better power to the M2 than the original cable did. Since the switch, I haven't had a single issue with the M2 and it's finally able to be the great USB interface that it is.<br /><br />On a final note, make sure that you are plugging the USB Type-A end of the cable into a USB 3.0 outlet on your computer. USB 3.0 is capable of providing more power output than USB 2.0 (900 milliamps vs. 500 milliamps) and is more power efficient than the older version. This gives the M2 the maximum available power to work with.<br /><br />If I had to do it all over, I would buy the M2 again. The inputs and outputs are just what I need, with my Sennheiser static microphone using the front XLR input, my studio monitors using the 1/4"" outputs, and my subwoofer using the RCA outputs. The front controls are easy to use and the knobs feel solid to turn, with just the perfect amount of resistance. If I had to say something negative, it would obviously be that I wished MOTU gave you a longer and better quality USB cable, especially considering this price of this interface.",[],B0812B26TN,B0812B26TN,AFBRECVTMWWC72HD4A73AOV2GHUA,1652458396460,11,True,2022-05-13 16:13:16.460

5.0,"A Beautiful Caxixi Shaker With A Unique Sound That Is Also A Handmade Instrument! Sadly, A Few Minor Blemishes In Craftsmanship!","1. How Does It Look?<br /><br />The double Caxixi shaker looks fairly clean, with a few imperfections in the craftsmanship here and there. I know that Africa Heartwood Project Instruments are handmade so I am pretty understanding of the small blemishes here and there. The blemishes are small marks/dirt on the bottom of the gourd pieces and the small strips of the woven material that peel off here and there.  &#34;0.75 STARS!&#34;<br /><br />2. Does It Sound Good?<br /><br />These particular Caxixi shakers have a louder, brighter sound and that also have a jingling sound that are made from the seeds, pebbles, and metal bottle caps that are on the inside. I have the single Caxixi shaker and I can tell that this double Caxixi is more full in its sound, which should be expected. The sound honestly, reminds me of the rings on a tambourine, except more clearer than my cheap tambourine. I was expecting it to have a more, quieter sound with just seeds on the inside like the colored caxixi from this company, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it had a different, yet wonderfully unique sound.  &#34;1.00 STARS!&#34;<br /><br />3. How Easy Is It To Use?<br /><br />It's super simple to get into a groove. It won't take long before you get the hang of it. Then you can accompany this caxixi with another shaker or instrument with your other hand when you become more familiar with the instrument.  &#34;1.00 STARS!&#34;<br /><br />4. How Does It Feel?<br /><br />The construction of the Caxixi feels pretty solid and I'm quite impressed. Even with its blemishes, it is more than stable and sturdy enough to hold together and it won't be falling apart on you anytime soon. Just don't drop it or step on it and it'll be okay.  &#34;1.00 STARS!&#34;<br /><br />5. Is It Worth The Price?<br /><br />I think this particular Caxixi is a better value than the single Caxixi because this one is only $2.50 more than the single shaker and sounds more full in my opinion. I think the price is more than fair for the quality it offers.  &#34;1.00 STARS!&#34;<br /><br />6. Should You Buy This?<br /><br />I think that you should give this shaker a try, especially if you want a unique piece that is handmade and that also produces a unique sound compared to other traditional shakers on the market.<br /><br />7.

Definitely a fun toy for a kid, or a good instrument for someone older who wants to make their own music.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IlDgdzbGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IlDgdzbGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IlDgdzbGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+Anc5idkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+Anc5idkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+Anc5idkL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-Ly80bFoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-Ly80bFoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-Ly80bFoL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7134Gi4CBJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7134Gi4CBJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7134Gi4CBJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GW-UsmJ-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GW-UsmJ-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GW-UsmJ-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P6YS+8keL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P6YS+8keL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P6YS+8keL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71V0cNdBojL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71V0cNdBojL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71V0cNdBojL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uhjdG6MOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uhjdG6MOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uhjdG6MOL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01DLYXX6E,B08Y14LVTY,AF3IT2TYCX2GG35BEVV5NXPKA6DQ,1510080045400,193,True,2017-11-07 18:40:45.400

5.0,Love the Seven Sisters,"There is a lot of good in this line of pedals. Long lasting rechargeable batteries, very small size, well tuned effects. This is not the most versatile delay pedal I've used, but it is quite useful in its range. It covers a nice range from a tight reverb all the way to an 800 millisecond delay. That is enough for me when playing live. Actually, I don't even need that much. With the small size, I could easily buy two and set them at different delays. The best part is that these pedals are very portable. I have six now and had to build my own board because I couldn't find one small enough to hold them. The only other pedal I need is a Wah - which I rarely use.<br /><br />Solid quality. Good sounding. Easy to use. The only challenge is that you have to open the case to change the wet/dry mix.

4.0,"Great compressor, but too many knobs and not enough gain.","I bought this pedal because I already own several other Wampler pedals, and knew this would be a great pedal. I've owned a few other Ross style compressors. The Keeley 2 Knob, which I ended up selling because there wasn't enough makeup gain, and the Xotic SP, which is my current compressor. I needed another compressor for a second board, so I gave the Ego a shot.<br /><br />First off, this is a GREAT sounding compressor, but doesn't have the volume boost that the SP has. And although it has more external controls, and more control over threshold (sweeping knob as opposed to Xotic's 3 positions), the SP does have similar control with internal DIP switches, and these are settings that I do not change, so I can set them, and forget them, and have only two knobs and a switch to worry about when on stage. Due to the excessive amount of knobs to get messed up before gigs, less overall volume, size, and cost, I returned it and bought another Xotic SP, but still, if you need quick access to attack and tone, and don't need a lot of extra volume boost (the Ego still has way more than the Keeley), then this pedal is a winner,",[],B003V0NILY,B07JL1KFT3,AFBKZOD66N6V66O3EU536PK2FIXA,1387958854000,12,True,2013-12-25 08:07:34.000

3.0,"Not my first use, but maybe my last","In all honesty, I've used this combo system before, and I knew before I bought another that it was passable at best. But it had been a long time, and I didn't really remember how middling the quality really was.<br /><br />We're shooting long runs of footage - presentations, group talks, Q&As and the like. The sound quality is really pretty mixed. What's funny is that something that people claim to have seen - RF dropouts - isn't happening to us although there's a huge amount of RFI where we are, including a HV overhead wire electric tram running past the receiver unit on a semi-regular basis.<br /><br />My big problem is that the exclusion for the lavalier is actually TOO much. I mean, I like good exclusion from a lavalier as much as the next guy, but the mic position was really the difference between getting something and getting nothing. We're talking 1-2cm difference in placement here. The gain/attenuation switch on the belt pack seemed to totally wreck the signal and was not worth using at all: either you set it to 0 and it was just sketchy, you set it to -10dB and got absolutely nothing, or you set it to ""mic"" and got a massively overdriven signal.<br /><br />All in all, would I use a Shure system again?

4.0,Colorful addition to your turntable,"Like many, I was intrigued with replacing my rubber mat with any of the numerous options available. After reading countless reviews and researching different brands and types, I decided on an acrylic mat. As part of my process, I measured my Technics platter, and the rubber mat and reviewed the spec dimensions of many acrylic mats.<br />I chose the green lit mat from Hudson HiFi and am very pleased with it. It comes well packaged, just like a brand new vinyl LP, with its firm cardboard cover, and inside you have the mat within a nice cover slip. The mat is designed as advertised and sits perfectly upon the Technics platter. The green adds a nice touch, and any ambient light will impact the boldness of the color. One picture shows very little light, the other under a direct light, and you can see the difference. Of course, listening to 45s will allow you to see more of the mats color as opposed to playing black vinyl LPs.<br />There have been no issues with it slipping on the platter or removing vinyl, be it a 45 or LP, from it. If you do have any issues with removing a 45, simply take off the adapter and then remove the record from the platter. I only had to do this with 2 of my 45s and it's not an issue at all.<br /><br />So far I have not been able to hear any major changes to the audio of any records I have listened to to, but have played only a small sample of my collection, so that could change. I highly recommend this acrylic mat, as it will add a nice color to your platter. Enjoy making the difficult decision on what color to get.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81+oNph4H8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81+oNph4H8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81+oNph4H8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/9156MwV0vBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/9156MwV0vBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/9156MwV0vBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B075BNTDBB,B075C767KK,AEBN35EZU7YUZZMVQQWA6LFQZXGA,1637684387247,2,True,2021-11-23 16:19:47.247

I‚Äôve held Tascam to a high degree of quality for a while, and I suspected that it‚Äôs name would maintain that quality throughout. ‚Äì Well, for its internal microphones, definitely. To use it as a preamp with external mics attached, definitely not.<br /><br />When you use the option to connect another mic, you have to access a menu option to power that mic through the Tascam. And it does so. Depending on the mic, like that of a directional mic, it takes processing power to power that mic as well as mobility to keep recording. Basically what I‚Äôm trying to say is that it skips if you‚Äôre actively running or moving too quickly. And if you‚Äôre going to use a lavalier mic, the skip is less pronounced, but it still happens. ANY EXTERNAL MIC makes the recording sound very different. And not in a good way. There‚Äôs a huge difference in the sound. Any directional mic will pick up a lot of rig-handling interference like never before. Even if you turn down the low cut to 220Hz, you still hear your fingers prod over the gymbal rig like an Aliens Facehugger at an anchorman‚Äôs mic of a stadium. It sounds like thunder and it‚Äôs definitely not wanted.<br /><br />If you use it for computer voice recording file transfers by itself, it‚Äôs totally worth its money. The internal mics provide the perfect mouth distance tonal range that your voice needs for whatever platform you may be uploading it to, without any processing.<br /><br />Right out the box, it works. But when you start to wonder it‚Äôs other capabilities, you‚Äôre gonna down yourself for what you find out. It just doesn‚Äôt playback well with external mics.

4.0,Makes for a good little ukulele,"Ukuleles are irresistible. I don't know what it is about them, but everyone loves ukuleles.  And this is a great way to get into one.  Inexpensive and fun to build.  It isn't hard to put together at all.  The hard parts have already been done for you.  The body comes pre-assembled.  The fret board is finished with fret wires already attached. Basically all you need to do is glue it up, sand, and finish.<br />The instruction booklet is well written and has plenty of information, including instructions for setting string height.<br /><br />It is relatively easy to assemble.<br />1. Step one is to pre-sand the parts, paying attention to not sand any glue areas.  I suggest you don't waste time with a sander.  This instrument is so small it is easier to hand sand.<br />2. The neck comes ready to glue to the body.  It is pre-shaped making it a cinch to glue up.  There is no pinning necessary, but if you use a good quality wood glue it should be OK.  The only bracing I can see inside the body is a block attached at the neck join that was probably intended for stapling the side lap. But if don't trust glue alone, the block is robust enough that you can add a dowel or two. I chose not to dowel mine. So far no problems.  I used a number of heavy rubber bands to secure the neck to the body while the glue dried.  I tried a strap clamp, but it was more trouble that it was worth.<br />3. The fretboard is just as easy to attach.  I suggest you re-drill the holes for the position dots.  As they came on my kit, they were much too small to accept the dot.  A piece of 320 grit sand paper wrapped around a Popsicle stick works great to file the dots down flush with the fretboard.<br />4. Once the neck and fretboard are down you can final sand in preparation for finishing.  You will need to tape off a spot on the front of the body for the bridge.  Measure carefully as position is important.  The instructions are very detailed so you shouldn't have any trouble.<br />5. Now you can carefully tape off the fretboard, and bridge and top nut areas.<br />6. Apply the finish of your choice.  The front and back of the body are mahogany plywood and would look great stained and lacquered.  But you can choose to paint it as well.  (We opted for a bright yellow enamel.)<br />7. Finish up by attaching the bridge and top nut, then install the tuners and strings.<br />8. Tune it up and make music!<br /><br />This is a fairly high quality kit, and all the really hard parts have already been done.  The price is certainly right.  And if you take your time you will end up with a quality instrument.  The sound is good and it is fun to play.  A great project to get into with the grandkids.

Don't really reccomend the cartride, and CERTAINLY don't reccomend the distributer.",[],B000T9P4LW,B000T9P4LW,AEZVU2QPUJSFQM3DTKC5WDZCXV4Q,1465462693000,0,True,2016-06-09 08:58:13.000
4.0,"Nice product, low price","The product's a good deal. They give you a bunch of fog liquid(which the machine doesn't use much of) and it works!<br />I had to give a four star because sometimes the switch's cord gets slightly unplugged from the fog machine and you have to push it in again. When I didn't know this, I thought it needed more juice, so I basically wasted half of the carton.  It also has to warm up after a bunch of fog, but it can fog out a medium room nicely. All in all, what a steal!",[],B003U02JAQ,B003U02JAQ,AHJCCESC5MRH2EPNUYYY2U7FIL3A,1319907653000,0,True,2011-10-29 17:00:53.000
5.0,A nice case for the price.,It‚Äôs a nice case. The padding is adequate and it fits my soprano outdoor ukulele just fine. It arrived without the strap But is soon as I let them know they sent one. The strap is adjustable and matches the case perfectly.<br />Update: I‚Äôve been using this case for about a year now. It‚Äôs holding up quite well.,[],B07314SVW1,B07314SVW1,AGMELAPBJXBCFHRDOOGE4DACHMRA,1548650223642,0,True,2019-01-28 04:37:03.642

5.0,Super easy to use,"I play as a one man band playing guitar, foot operated drumpad, and vocals simultaneously.

4.0,Good for the price,I got this pop filter because it was the cheapest one I could get to simply have one and it works exceptionally. By no means would I recommend this to someone who wishes to have a good quality difference in sound. Simply having a pop filter is what I was looking for and that's what I got. the fabric in this one is a lot thinner than others I have used and in some cases that's completely fine. If you're into heavy screamo music this probably isn't the pop filter for you. It just doesn't block out enough crackling for that.,[],B001F4SHBY,B001F4SHBY,AE6QP4H25B4TD62GBHUVSPFKUM5Q,1315829449000,0,True,2011-09-12 12:10:49.000
